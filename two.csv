I am a goal-orientated, tenacious individual who is always enthusiastic and hard-working when approaching a new challenge. My time as a student have refined my time management skills and have improved my communication skills immensely. Having done a lot of group work, I have had interaction with a variety of people and I am quite good at assessing group dynamics. I am not afraid of hard work, seeing first hand whilst studying for my postgraduate degree how it can pay off. My various experiences have made me an approachable, well-rounded individual and have made me adaptable to varying situations.

I always have an organised approach to my work as time management and multi-tasking are vital in a busy Human Resources Department.

I enter all activities with the utmost enthusiasm and commitment. As a competitive person, I am not happy until I have mastered a task and I have this approach to my professional life.

JOHN IKEL has been working in the investment banking sector since the start of 1998, where he started in IT support, before moving into market data analysis and project management in 2002. He assumed global responsibility for market data compliance shortly after as well as the management of market data audits within EMEA. From 2009-2013, he ran a highly successful market data consultancy providing expertise in market data compliance and end-to-end management of market data audit to financial institutions. In the first 6 months of operation we saved client firms €4.6m through the negotiation of audit settlements with €millions more saved in future exposure costs negated through managing data compliance issues across in-house applications.  He has also spoken on the subject at industry events such as IPUG (Information Providers User Group, the UK market data consortium), where he was also the Chairman of the Executive Committee, at COSSIOM (the French market data consortium), and at FISD.

He is a hard working team player with a keen analytical skill-set and a passion for technology. He constantly looks for ways to do things more efficiently and gets satisfaction from a job well done. His extensive technical skills and ability to think outside the box bring an added dimension to any project he manages.  

Married with three children, John has been a qualified karate instructor since 2011 and teaches a class of around 30 students of all ages and abilities every weekend.

Now recognized as an ESG Subject matter expert, thought leader and strategist given my broad range of experience across the ESG (Environment Social & Corporate Governance) spectrum from buy side to sell side and everything in between.

Highly reputed in the ESG space, I have uplifted two banks to number one for sustainability research and elevated SSGA to a market influencer. Often invited to speak at conferences, I address material ESG issues and themes that may impact long-term returns. I have spoken with the Belgian Central Bank and Head of Asset Management for European Commission about Stewardship.

Passionate about building client relationships, I spend time understanding client needs to help them on their journey, particularly in the stewardship space. As a strong communicator, I effectively explain often quite complicated information into easy-to-understand narrative to help clients achieve their objectives.

Working externally with clients or internally with investment teams and senior leaders, I educate people on the importance of ESG. My focus is to demonstrate what they are doing, the impact of what they are doing, and why this stuff matters.

Career Highlights:

· Ranked number one for corporate governance equity research and being recognised for my research at two different financial institutions.

· Invited to speak on a panel organised by sovereign government and central banks in 2019 about ESG with foreign leaders and highly influential people from European Central Banks.

· Worked with CEO of SSGA to launch Corporate Call to Action, an initiative set up by State Treasurer of Connecticut. Our proposal to publicly disclose workforce demographic data was chosen as the launch initiative.

Areas of expertise: Stewardship/ESG, Sustainability, Corporate Governance, Thought Leadership, Senior Engagement, Communication & Presentation, Stewardship Strategy, Team Leadership & Talent Development, Report Writing, Research, Client Focus.

In my spare time, I enjoy kickboxing; follow and play football & cricket competitively.",,,"London, England, United Kingdom",3 months in role,3 months in company,3rd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E03AQF8zB1D9vNH2A/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1668430945218?e=1677110400&v=beta&t=frd0Ho8dTe_kb2weqs5lqaZHyo5-KL6W-aj9iVMFZ94,0,Robert (Rob) Walker,ACwAAAE1vH4BWIdml0WQSY-BoFwKSalpKE664qo,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAE1vH4BWIdml0WQSY-BoFwKSalpKE664qo/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=%28recentSearchParam%3A%28id%3A1886079306%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue%29%2Cfilters%3AList%28%28type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A497017%2Ctext%3AMorgan%2520Stanley%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A101165590%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520Kingdom%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A104738515%2Ctext%3AIreland%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A4%2Ctext%3ASenior%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A10%2Ctext%3AOwner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A9%2Ctext%3APartner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A8%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A7%2Ctext%3AVP%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A6%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A5%2Ctext%3AManager%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A3%2Ctext%3AEntry%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A2%2Ctext%3ATraining%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A1%2Ctext%3AUnpaid%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28text%3Amarketing%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%2CcontainsChildren%3Afalse%2CselectedChildren%3AList%28%29%29%2C%28text%3Adirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2CcontainsChildren%3Afalse%2CselectedChildren%3AList%28%29%29%2C%28text%3Aglobal%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%29%29&sessionId=pAhOCUBYSoiBSQpSJSpHUg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true%0A,2022-12-22T01:45:07.891Z,

This qualification assists the industry in distinguishing the top echelon of SQL Server experts worldwide and is held by a very small number of people.

After working as a SQL Server Engineer and developing new Powershell and TSQL scripts to install and manage SQL Server and support everything from HA and DR, Maintenance Tasks, Security, etc., I was promoted to become the Global Head of the SQL Server Database Engineering team. I built and lead a high-performing team of SQL Server Database/Infrastructure Engineers who are based in London and Montreal.

I am the product owner for SQL Server and work with management, DBAs and clients, to define the future direction for SQL Server.  I am also the highest level of escalation for SQL Server at Morgan Stanley and I am called when there are serious outages. I have worked with Microsoft Engineers for them to give us special patches for our environment.

I am now focused on and working on our Azure SQL public cloud journey with focus on migration, automation, orchestration, access management, security, encryption and integration with on-prem environments.

I have recently achieved various Azure Data related Microsoft Certifications namely:
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Fundamentals
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Database Administrator Associate
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer Associate

I have also delivered a session at SQLBits, the biggest SQL Server Conference in the UK/Europe.",Financial Services,"New York, New York, United States","London, England, United Kingdom",7 years 1 month in role,12 years 6 months in company,3rd,,0,Ajay Jadoo,ACwAAACA_RMB3eJpwG5wzTpWID91xvEVZMXQFno,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAACA_RMB3eJpwG5wzTpWID91xvEVZMXQFno/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=%28recentSearchParam%3A%28id%3A1886079306%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue%29%2Cfilters%3AList%28%28type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A497017%2Ctext%3AMorgan%2520Stanley%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A101165590%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520Kingdom%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A104738515%2Ctext%3AIreland%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A4%2Ctext%3ASenior%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A10%2Ctext%3AOwner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A9%2Ctext%3APartner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A8%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A7%2Ctext%3AVP%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A6%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A5%2Ctext%3AManager%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A3%2Ctext%3AEntry%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A2%2Ctext%3ATraining%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A1%2Ctext%3AUnpaid%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28text%3Amarketing%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%2CcontainsChildren%3Afalse%2CselectedChildren%3AList%28%29%29%2C%28text%3Adirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2CcontainsChildren%3Afalse%2CselectedChildren%3AList%28%29%29%2C%28text%3Aglobal%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%29%29&sessionId=pAhOCUBYSoiBSQpSJSpHUg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true%0A,2022-12-22T01:45:11.851Z,"I am the Global Head of the SQL Server (on-Prem and Azure) Database Infrastructure Engineering team and I built and lead a high-performing Agile team of SQL Server Database/Infrastructure Engineers who are based in London and Montreal.

I am expert in strategic, operational and financial planning, building multi-location teams and achieving consensus across stakeholders.

I started my career in Big 4 audit, quickly moving to advisory projects for top-tier and mid-sized retail banks, building societies and regulators. I specialised in the unwind of complex financial instrument portfolios and gained an 18 month secondment to the Bank of England to perform a key role in active contingency planning for potential failures of UK banks. I subsequently moved in-house to Morgan Stanley, where I later led the firm's European activities to plan for severe financial stress or failure.  I  now focus on corporate entity structure. 

My role focuses on change management and strategic implementation. I am expert in simplifying complexity and use emotional intelligence to lead teams and stakeholders through periods of change and transformation.  I draw on strengths in multi-disciplinary collaboration, consensus building, constructive challenge, exceptional organisation skills and clear communication to help the business implement challenging projects.  

While my career to date has been working at or for (as a consultant) large firms, within those I have founded and grown teams, including co-founding and leading and advisory team at Deloitte and growing a team at Morgan Stanley 50% by headcount.

My key strengths are:

- Structured, logical thinking: skilled at taking complex concepts and distilling them into clearly understandable explanations and ideas; I apply this to solve problems effectively and efficiently

- Clear communication, both written and spoken, enabling effective collaboration and challenge from stakeholders: I have applied this to support both the development of my team through to presentation to Board and Committee level governance.  I have substantial experience of presenting at key governance committees, including Operating Committees, Risk and Audit Committees and Boards.

- Lead with empathy: I have successfully built strong multi-disciplinary teams, including across cultures

- Very organised and efficient: I am highly productive and have a demonstrated ability to direct implementation projects in an efficient, collaborative and strategic manner

- Financial literacy: I am a Chartered Accountant (Fellow Chartered Accountant, FCA) and have a deep understanding of capital, liquidity and funding.",Financial Services,"New York, New York, United States","London, England, United Kingdom",7 months in role,8 years  in company,2nd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQH1z8DRmgnF-w/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1652550847917?e=1677110400&v=beta&t=Pon3QIOHRuGKIxND6P6kVUku7on23ng-76_uaFyJ13k,0,Rachael McCullough,ACwAAAmgfq8Bi67prZaJTdW6tXl_1Bfw-o3Bbe4,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAmgfq8Bi67prZaJTdW6tXl_1Bfw-o3Bbe4/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=%28recentSearchParam%3A%28id%3A1886079306%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue%29%2Cfilters%3AList%28%28type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A497017%2Ctext%3AMorgan%2520Stanley%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A101165590%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520Kingdom%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A104738515%2Ctext%3AIreland%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A4%2Ctext%3ASenior%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A10%2Ctext%3AOwner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A9%2Ctext%3APartner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A8%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A7%2Ctext%3AVP%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A6%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A5%2Ctext%3AManager%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A3%2Ctext%3AEntry%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A2%2Ctext%3ATraining%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A1%2Ctext%3AUnpaid%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28text%3Amarketing%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%2CcontainsChildren%3Afalse%2CselectedChildren%3AList%28%29%29%2C%28text%3Adirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2CcontainsChildren%3Afalse%2CselectedChildren%3AList%28%29%29%2C%28text%3Aglobal%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%29%29&sessionId=pAhOCUBYSoiBSQpSJSpHUg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true%0A,2022-12-22T01:45:56.990Z,Corporate entity structure and ad hoc projects.

I wanted to gain experience of working in a front-office technology environment. I spent my first year developing a system to provide an overview of the oil and freight market to support schedulers and traders. Subsequently I worked on migrating the power and gas trading system to a new platform. I then spent a year in the Credit e-trading space, migrating a multi-million line Java codebase onto standard open source libraries.

I then moved into Interest Rate Derivatives migrating various desk tools onto a common Fixed Income wide codebase. I led a team of between 5 and 10 people primarily revolving around Interest Rate Volatility calibrators for various pricing models such as SABR, and associated tooling. During this time we made many contributions to the core platform.

This led to my current role leading the UI framework team for the platform, involving multiple technologies and strategic decision making, supporting hundreds of developers across the bank. I'm still hands-on working in Scala, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C# and Python as required across the whole tech stack. I work with a great team emblematic of the talent at Morgan Stanley."

A truly inspiring quote that reaffirms my belief in focusing one’s mind on achieving what one wants. I believe one should have a growth mindset for creating a framework for success. Throughout my 12+ years in the BFSI, I have achieved numerous successes by developing new skills, believing in my own capacity to learn and grow, and embracing failure as a teaching tool. Also, my growth mindset enabled me to excel in public speaking, learn data mining and data visualisation skills, and hone my project management abilities.         

Always intrigued by numbers, I commenced my career with JP Morgan Services India after completing a Bachelor’s degree in accounting and finance. In my 7+ years’ tenure with the company, I managed and improved performance of high- and low-value treasury SWIFT payment processing systems. My firm belief (in generating positive results) coupled with impactful action, helped grow company’s revenue and reduce its costs, significantly.        

Currently, I am a global lead at Morgan Stanley, in charge of, leading reference data services analytics team. Here, my growth mindset helped me formulate an effective strategy for increasing automation, drive key India-level operations automation and innovation initiatives, and develop dashboards and tools. Also, I led a change initiative to increase automation, improve efficiency, and build controls within product reference data.   

Cooking, learning new technologies, and reading help me unwind. My hobbies not only help improve my focus, but also, provide me with inspiration to innovate.

Through my roles as Team Leader, I have gained experience in understanding the strengths of my team members and allocating tasks accordingly to meet deadlines or deliver the required service. I’ve led with example in Morgan Stanley by being the go to person for advanced tasks/problems and always look to encourage the team in their day to day tasks 
 
Teamwork 
I have worked as part of various teams during my studies and at work, in doing so I have learned how to discuss tasks and project objectives, listen to the views and perspectives of other team members and work together to complete tasks on time.  
 
Communication 
I have developed strong verbal and written skills during my studies and by working in a busy retail environment, where constant interaction is required with customers and employees.  My experience of tutoring school pupils also demonstrates I can communicate clearly at different levels and clarify understanding. By participating in conference calls with important clients for MS, I have built a strong relationship with our brokers and have gained each other’s trust and respect to the delight of our OCRM Representatives. 
 
IT 
I am proficient in the use of Windows XP, Internet and e-mail. Through university and work I have had exposure to various technical software packages and in-house databases and I am able to familiarize and become competent with new software packages easily.

After achieving a Chemistry degree from Oxford, I joined Deloitte & Touche’s London office, where I qualified as chartered accountant (ACA) in 2003.  I then worked for Deutsche Bank until 2010 (with the last two years spent in their Hong Kong office).  I have worked for Morgan Stanley ever since, where I was promoted to Executive Director.  I returned to London with them in August 2019.

My work for Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley has been within the Finance side (mainly Equities and, to a lesser extent, Fixed Income).  It has encompassed a wide range of roles:
   • Managing teams of product controllers
   • Migrating functions to offshore locations
   • Managing operational risk (Finance Risk Lead function)
   • Driving large scale and global projects

   • Identifying efficiency opportunities (e.g. through automation)
   • Working across teams (Finance, Operations, Front Office, IT) to implement change

When i joined i was tasked with creating the Chennai team who are now fully developed and are responsible for the daily quality assurance tasks within the team. This highlights my leadership skills as training a new team in a remote location virtually brought around its own challenges which i overcame to build the successful team I now manage.

My team is tasked with monitoring and analyzing client activities in order to detect and curtail fraud in order to protect the firm and its clients. My team’s primary responsibilities are the identification, mitigation, and incident management of potential fraudulent banking transactions detected by a suite of detection tools.

My team is directly responsible for the firms Fraud Alerts Monitoring and Call Back Verification policy and processes ensuring firm payments are in a secure and accurate state before release, following the firms key authentication controls. Collaborating with Payment Teams to investigate specific wire transfer validity and accuracy to determine if fraud or misrepresentation exists for payments not recorded within Firms books and records is a daily responsibility for my team.

I continuously work to enhance and improve our Internal and External control framework to protect the firm against Cyber Payment Fraud.

Responsible for Operational Risk and Control including incident management, information security, cyber/technology risk, vendor management and outsourcing governance in addition to overseeing key cyclical activities such as RCSA, SSAE18, Recovery & Resolution planning and audits/exams. 

I manage a team of Risk professionals across three locations (New York, London and Mumbai) and prioritise their workload based on internal metrics (KRIs/KPIs and trend analysis), Firm requirements and external developments.

Prior to joining Morgan Stanley I was a partner at Addleshaw Goddard in London and at Cordells in Hong Kong, a specialist real estate law firm which I co-founded. I have substantial experience in advising on the acquisition, leasing, funding and development of all types of commercial real estate and have particular expertise in occupational leasing and data centre transactions. 

My experience encompasses transactions in London, Hong Kong and across Asia including Japan, Indonesia, India and the PRC giving me a broad understanding of the Asian region and the requirements of international occupiers, landlords and investors. Experience includes advising an international bank as the purchaser in one of Hong Kong's largest ever single office acquisitions. I have also advised international occupiers and investors on a cross-border basis throughout Europe.

Technology on its own is rarely the limiting factor - organising people, priorities, budgets, agendas and capabilities, along with successful technology strategy and delivery is necessary and is what I enjoy doing.",Financial Services,"New York, New York, United States","London, England, United Kingdom",3 years 9 months in role,4 years 4 months in company,2nd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQFPhx1HDlrWHQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1516564474370?e=1677110400&v=beta&t=ypznoVbMjwLK1HQCK6u5IG2hemWPwQLBATlHsU8Xaes,1,Jain Shah,ACwAAAMdhhwB6gRJKwoSJc_Rz3whE__ENNuaAjs,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAMdhhwB6gRJKwoSJc_Rz3whE__ENNuaAjs/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=%28recentSearchParam%3A%28id%3A1886079306%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue%29%2Cfilters%3AList%28%28type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A497017%2Ctext%3AMorgan%2520Stanley%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A101165590%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520Kingdom%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A104738515%2Ctext%3AIreland%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28id%3A4%2Ctext%3ASenior%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A10%2Ctext%3AOwner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A9%2Ctext%3APartner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A8%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A7%2Ctext%3AVP%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A6%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A5%2Ctext%3AManager%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A3%2Ctext%3AEntry%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A2%2Ctext%3ATraining%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%2C%28id%3A1%2Ctext%3AUnpaid%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%29%29%29%2C%28type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList%28%28text%3Amarketing%2CselectionType%3AEXCLUDED%2CcontainsChildren%3Afalse%2CselectedChildren%3AList%28%29%29%2C%28text%3Adirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2CcontainsChildren%3Afalse%2CselectedChildren%3AList%28%29%29%2C%28text%3Aglobal%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%29%29%29%29%29&sessionId=pAhOCUBYSoiBSQpSJSpHUg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true%0A,2022-12-22T01:48:01.357Z,Global Head Data CoE Tooling

The team consists of 40 members distributed across 4 squads/scrum teams formed by developers, testers, business analysts, product owners following the agile scrum methodology.

I am the Global Head of Business Analysis for Global Transaction Reporting Technology in Morgan Stanley. The team consists of around 40 Business Analysts across US, UK and India. Previously I was the Regional Head of OTC Derivatives Confirmations Technology in London, where I worked since 2006.

Prior to MS I worked for Net2S Limited as an Associate Consultant developing a web-based risk management tool for Visa International (.NET Remoting, C#) on site. And before that as a Teaching Assistant for the modules ""Software Engineering"" (Java and UML) and ""Computers in Society"" at Queen Mary University of London. 

Whilst working on my MSc in Denmark (2002 - 2004), I designed a language and developed a compiler enabling distributed communication between digital devices (based on Java RMI). 

During my three-year work experience in Brazil I designed and developed various web-based applications (UML, Java, Javascript, HTML, XML, etc), mostly working within large teams where my communication and interpersonal skills have been essential. 

My career aspiration is to work on a challenging dynamic and demanding global environment where I can foster my team members career development, develop my own career, deliver often and collaborate with other teams towards a common strategy.

During my time with Morgan Stanley I have been fortunate enough to work in a variety of roles- starting out in Fixed Income product control before moving on to a number of project related deployment roles- bringing work into Glasgow from London and NY. During this period I became CIMA qualified before beginning to specialise in Market Risk/Regulatory Capital & reporting where I have worked for the past ten or so years. 

Working in this area has provided great experience in managing and developing large teams, working as part of a global team,  planning and executing inward and outward deployments and has provided me with a well rounded understanding of the Regulatory landscape (e.g. Basel framework, COREP, Pillar III).

On a more personal level I have two young daughters who keep me busy and outside of that (where time allows!) I still like to chip away at golf and generally try and keep fit.
