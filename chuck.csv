In a recent televised debate, the two candidates running for the office of Los Angeles County Sheriff vigorously argued and attacked one another. At times it got ugly. But then the debate moderator asked them what their favorite TV show was. They both said “The Big Bang Theory,” then laughed and high-fived one another. Naturally, I was delighted. The Sheriff’s department operates the seven big jails in L.A. County. If things go horribly wrong in my life, I might be able to swap a fleece-lined show jacket for a room with a view — no matter who wins the election."

Watching the funeral of QE2, I can’t help thinking that before I go in the ground, it’d be nice to lie in state for a couple of days. (I know the Jewish tradition insists on a quick internment, but I’m sure there’s a rabbinical workaround with dry ice.) I also like the slow- moving mourners’ queue that, depending on gender identification, ends with a bow or curtsy. (I would ask those people who identify as non- binary to pay their respects with some other physical gesture. Maybe a quick robot or salsa dance move.) And instead of a scepter, orb and crown on top of my box, I’d like a simple key lime pie. Finally, when it’s time to go to the cemetery, please don’t make my dog sit and watch the hearse drive by like they did with the queen’s corgis. That’s just heartbreaking. Get somebody to take him to the beach to play fetch.
Oh, one more thing. There should be lying-in-state music. I’m a big fan of a pretty woman in a long black gown playing the cello. It’s elegant, sad as hell, and way cheaper than John Legend."

I recently underwent a medical procedure that allowed me to see video of my heart beating. I found myself filled with gratitude towards this miraculous muscle that has kept me alive for almost seventy years. Without thinking, I said thank you and apologized for having mistreated it in the past. The technician performing the procedure looked up and asked if I was alright. I explained that I was thanking my heart for a job well done and making an amends of sort. She smiled and said she liked the Charlie Sheen Two and a Half Men better than the Ashton Kutcher version. Unbothered, my heart just kept beating."

On behalf of everyone on Young Sheldon, thank you for watching. We know you have many choices. Boy oh boy, do you have choices. It’s crazy to think how many choices you have. In fact, some people think there are too many choices. Browsing through the endless offerings on streaming sites can feel like being hungry in a supermarket. Despite the beautifully displayed cornucopia, you often leave frustrated and empty-handed. Or worse, furtively eating an old bag of cookies in the produce aisle. So once again, thank you for choosing to watch Young Sheldon. A happy meal. And, unlike streaming, a free meal. Unless you assign a dollar value to the nine minutes you spent watching com- mercials. Just for the heck of it, let’s say it’s eleven cents. Not quite free cheese samples in the supermarket, but pretty darn close."

I believe that the best way to free oneself from anger, is to pray for the welfare of those who cause that anger. For example, “God, please give Vladimir Putin everything he needs to feel happy and loved.” I know it’s counter-intuitive, but given enough time and repetition, it actually works. One day, you wake up and realize the toxic anger has been miraculously replaced with a sense of peace. A neutral equanimi- ty from which you can make rational decisions that effectively respond to, or ignore, malicious behavior. To be honest, I’m not sure if this is an actual spiritual practice, or simply a means to reroute neuronal pathways that are otherwise hardwired for the debilitating flow of negative emotions like hatred and rage. It probably doesn’t matter. The result is the same. Which means I’m eventually going to be groovy with Mitch McConnell."

I have a vanity card due today.  I haven’t written anything yet.
8 AM - 1963
I am feverishly doing my homework on the bus to school.
9:12 AM - May 5, 2022
Speaking of 1963, my fifth grade teacher, Mr. Penzel, used to put up catchy truisms where we’d be sure to read them - under the clock. One was, “Procrastination is the thief of time.”
I can’t believe that has stayed with me all these years. I can’t be- lieve I’m still a victim of this crime. I can’t believe I remember Mr. Penzel. (I even remember his first name!)
Anyway, the bus is pulling up in front of Oak Drive Elementary School. Here is my sloppily written, rambling vanity card that barely gets a passing grade. Story of my life. Sorry, Irwin. You tried."

I’d like to take this opportunity to thank you for watching network TV. There was a time when thanks were not necessary. Network TV was your only choice. Oh sure, there were local television stations, but they mainly existed to provide you with local news and Plan 9 From Outer Space. If one were to take a karmic view of things, one might think that the rapidly diminishing reach of network TV is the in- evitable result of inferior shows. Ignoring the obnoxious use of the word “one”, that doesn’t explain Norman Lear, Steven Bochco, the Charles brothers, Jerry Seinfeld and Dharma & Greg. Another possible villain in this story of tragic decline could be commercials. Since the dawn of network television, the audience was entertained for free. You paid with your attention. Now, with streaming television, your attention is mostly irrelevant. You pay with money. Which makes me wonder, what would network TV look like if it dumped the commercials and charged viewers a small monthly fee (personally, I would gladly fork over a few bucks to never again see that %&@! Australian gecko). But that’s not likely to happen. Giant corporations don’t pivot. They lumber. They trudge. They slog. That said, network TV has been extremely good to me. So, once again, thanks for watching!"

I still read newspapers. By that I mean actual newspapers. Yes, I have the related apps on my phone and laptop, but I only use them on the odd mornings when the papers are delivered late, or, God forbid, not at all. My reasoning is simple. I enjoy holding paper. Turning pages. Folding pages. Doing the daily Jumble with a pen in order to access my cognitive abilities. Trying not to read the obits. Seeking out my favorite opinion writers to laugh or see what I think (Maureen Dowd! Thomas L. Friedman!). I get two papers delivered every morn- ing. The Los Angeles Times and the New York Times - despite the fact that the NYT has never had one good thing to say about me. Seriously, thirty years, not one &@#$ing thing. But I forgive them. Partly be- cause they are the paper of record. But mostly because of Maureen Dowd. Anyway, I fully recognize my anachronistic behavior. But I’m okay with it. Every day these two papers give me a glimpse into this wonderful, horrifying world. And let’s face it, you can’t line the birdcage with an iPad."

I’ve written about this before, but I think it deserves more atten- tion. For sentient life to continue being sentient life, it needs to kill and eat other, presumably less sentient life. Now I enjoy a good hamburger as much as the next omnivore, but this has always struck me as a macabre and repugnant system. Life lives on death? Oh, please. How hard would it have been to design Homo Saps that rock the casbah with a little photosynthesis? Apply that to all predators, keep the herbivores trimming the bushes and mowing the lawn, maybe loosen up the genetic expiration date on a few species (dogs obviously need to live for seventy, eighty years) and bippity-boppity-boo, we’ve got an ecosystem in which no one, or no thing, experiences needless suffer- ing. Yeah, I know what you’re thinking. Photosynthesis requires sun- light, and sunlight can cause melanoma. Way ahead of you. That’s where Big Pharma comes in. Okay, but what about evolution and sur- vival of the fittest? To that I say, look around. How much fitness do you see? So there you go, a design for a better universe, free of charge, in one vanity card. And I didn’t even graduate from SUNY Potsdam. (Go Bears!)"

In Memoriam
The year was 1960. I was eight years old. I went to see a movie called The Time Machine and fell hopelessly in love. From the minute Yvette appeared on screen, I was smitten. She played an Eloi, a mem- ber of a beautiful, frustratingly passive race of people in the far, far future. The Eloi were the sole food source for the horrible, troll-like Morlocks. Needless to say, this was a very stressful mati- nee for me. I didn’t want the woman of my dreams to be eaten. Thankfully, she was rescued and I didn’t have to cope with cinematic tragedy until I saw Steve McQueen die in The Sand Pebbles (I’m still upset over that). So I would like to pay tribute to my first crush, Yvette Mimieux. My second crush came a few years later. Raquel Welch, trying not to be eaten while running around in a fur bikini."

I’ve lived in Southern California for a very long time. I’ve weath- ered earthquakes, fires, floods, mudslides, smog alerts, Y2K, omicron, Comic-Con, and the occasional riot. But recently something new was added to the list of things to be afraid of. Tsunamis. Specifically one caused by Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai (which, forgive me, sounds like Jerry Lewis ordering dinner at Benihana immediately after having his wisdom teeth removed). While I was fairly clear on earthquake safety protocols, I found myself ill-prepared for a tsunami. Should I anticipate a run on snorkels and water wings at my local pool supply store? Should I seek higher ground? And how high are we talking? The wave in Back to the Beach or the one in The Day After Tomorrow? Big difference. And finally, is this likely to be a local calamity? A horrific inundation of the left coast that the citizens of Kentucky find wildly amusing. Or is it the beginning of a global, Old Testa- ment rinse cycle? In which case, I need to quickly find myself a wise old man of the Abrahamic persuasion who knows his way around an ark. Hmm... David Geffen?"

A friend recently commented that in the last few years my vanity cards have swung from sharply partisan and opinionated, to... well, banal. He conceded that while, at times, they could be mildly amusing, in the end they were no more than wordy riffs on... well, nothing. I assured him he was absolutely correct. I explained that in this rabid politi- cal and cultural climate, I had made a conscious decision to lay low. I had no desire to write something that might offend someone, when that offense initiates a response which questions my right to breathe. And yes, the word for my decision is cowardice. A shrinking away from confrontation in the hopes that I might continue to enjoy existing. Does this call into question my character? Perhaps. Probably. I don’t care. I had a warm blueberry muffin this morning. It was deli- cious. A few weeks ago I was thrilled by the Super Bowl. Win or lose, watching LeBron James play basketball is a sublime gift. I have been happily binge-watching everything written by Taylor Sheridan. My dog’s daily expression of unconditional love fills my heart. My chil- dren’s Father’s Day expression of unconditional love is amusing. And then there’s music. And theater. And art. Good health. Good friends. Good books. The love of a good woman (not to offend bad women). And golf. And laughter. (Tolerating the snickering of my buddies when I’m incapable of getting out of a sand trap, allows me the freedom to do the same when they shank a chip shot into the park- ing lot.) And don’t get me started on the simple joys of good food, a good night’s sleep, a good bowel movement (deftly avoiding a word that might offend), and any kind of sex. If being unwilling to trade all these quality of life moments for making myself a target of hatred is cowardly, then so be it. That said, I am not without moments of brav- ery. Despite his astute observation, I have been ghosting the “friend” who made the snarky comments about my vanity cards."

                          THE DEARLY DELETED
I know I’m not alone when it comes to confronting a heartbreakingly surreal smartphone task. Whether or not to delete the contact info of friends and relatives who have died. Is it better to just leave it alone? A sort of digital gravestone that blindsides you with memories while scrolling? Or could a healing ritual be created that removes the deceased person’s data in a loving and respectful way? Smartphone manufacturers could add a new button to their devices that allows us to “set free” or “release” phone numbers and email addresses, rather than hit “delete” (which we can all agree is the worst possible word for this undertaking). Even if he was a mean sonuvabitch, no one wants to delete Uncle Murray. Another approach might be creating a cloud-based heaven where our loved ones’ phone data is stored for a small monthly fee. That way, when your heart is aching, you could call and leave a message. Of course if your caller ID says you’re getting an incoming call from Great Grandma Becky, it might be time to walk toward the light."

Sometimes when I walk past another person I hold my breath.
I visualize the six feet “safe” distance by imagining myself lying on the ground minus one inch.
I tried to avoid a person I disliked by pretending to sneeze into my N95 mask. The idiot didn’t take the hint.
I’ve become mildly phobic around small children.
When I blow my nose I compulsively check the Kleenex for anything that looks worrisome.
While masked, I’ve been trying to smile with my eyes. I’ve even taken to practicing in front of a mirror. Rather than happy, I look vaguely constipated.
Every time I get an email stating that my PCR test is negative, I feel oddly proud. Like I’ve accomplished something.
My dog loves to meet and sniff other dogs. Regardless, when I walk him I steer us away from other dogs and their owners as a health pre- caution. I’ve tried to explain this to him, but he just gives me the stink eye."

I’m at that time of life when thoughts of mortality are ever-present. When it’s not preposterous to think that this next exhalation could be followed by a meet and greet with Yahweh. That my heart, which has beat for so long, never once resting, might simply have had enough (I believe the technical term is ‘kaput’). That there will be no need to interrupt tonight’s sleep with a trip to the bathroom. Urination is for the living. That a stranger’s muffled cough in an elevator means the next floor is toe tags and rigor mortis. That a car ride to get an over-the-counter antacid after inhaling a bowl of spaghetti bolog- nese could end with the jaws of life, followed by the gaping maw of darkness, followed by being poured into an urn. I often comfort my- self from these morbid musings by thinking that when my time comes, when my race is run, when my song is sung, when my bell is rung, when my freshly-washed laundry is hung, I will finally make it onto the Emmy stage. My photograph will briefly appear while a lone woman in a simple black gown plays the cello during the In Memoriam segment.

You only live once. A common trope. But is it true? I have been a baby, a toddler, a child, an adolescent, a young man, a middle-aged man, and now, a five-eighths-aged man. Digging a little deeper, I have been a son, a student, a scrappy shortstop, a bar mitzvah boy, a stoner, a patient, a failed musician, a failed songwriter, a failed Dianetic Clear, a dad, a failed husband, a relentless door-to-door salesman, a failed husband again, a drunk, a professional wise guy, a teetotaler, and, miraculously, a success. Which one was me? Which incarnation was my one life? I believe if these different me’s were to meet (idea for a play?), there would likely be no recognition. At best, they’d view each other as strangers. At worst, as idiots. So maybe the real question isn’t whether we live only once. Maybe we should be wondering how many times we die and become something new. Something else."

I spend a lot of time with me. It’s not always a good time. Like any couple, we bicker and are often critical of one another. But then there are moments, when I and me are fully in synch. Both of us hap- py, productive members of Team Chuck (or more accurately, Team Chucks). We are totally cool if you refer to us as “you,” “he,” “him,” or “dudemeister,” but we prefer the pronouns “we,” “us,” “our,” or “y’all.” When we stop to think about it - and boy oh boy, do we think about it - it makes perfect sense. If we did not identify as cis-plural, we’d be talking to ourselves like meth addicts detoxing with hard seltzer. This way we’re simply enjoying an internal conver- sation, a dialogue, a debate, a Q & A, an attaboy, a silent screaming match, or a poor employee performance review.

Are we capable of change? Can we decide to be other than who we are? Who we’ve been? And if such a change were possible, how would it be- gin? With a daily affirmation into a bathroom mirror that hides the benzodiazepines? A firm, no-nonsense, bootstrap decision following a morning of self-loathing and an unwanted house guest? A violent head injury that leaves us with a vacant stare and a childlike smile? A daily regimen of prayer to a benevolent omniscience that takes re- quests? A devastating emotional loss that leads to a short dog (check your urban dictionary) in a paper bag? Or perhaps the answer lies elsewhere. Maybe peace of mind lies in foregoing a need for change and accepting ourselves as we are. The “I’m okay, you’re okay” school of thought. It would then follow that everything wrong with us is added on, not inherent. Personal growth, real change, is a result of subtraction, not addition. We are not, fundamentally, muddle-headed a-holes. Or, as a friend of mine often liked to say, “God made us perfect and she never changed her mind.”"

The first time I said the f word I was five or six. I had no idea what it meant, but some older kids encouraged me to say it to my fa- ther. I walked up to him while he was talking to some other adults and just blurted it out. No context. Just the f word with a happy exclamation mark. He slapped the crap out of me (it was a different time). Since then I’ve said it a lot. So much so, I’ve decided to give it a rest. Yes, it’s a time-tested way to express anger, out- rage, surprise, despair, exhilaration, pain, confusion and full-body orgasms. Yes, it makes jokes 17% funnier. Yes, with minor alter- ations it’s deployable as a noun, verb, pronoun, interjection, con- junction, adverb, and adjective. Yes, you feel like David Mamet when you use it three times in one sentence. And yes, it can cause deliri- um tremens when used as a drinking game during an episode of Succes- sion. But no, I won’t be saying the f word anymore. I like to think that my father would be proud.

At the risk of fueling the ongoing debate over the efficacy and safety of the COVID vaccine, I’d like to point out some of the more troubling side effects I’ve experienced since receiving my double inoculation last spring.
1. Acid reflux, particularly if I go to bed right after a spicy din- ner.
2. I’ve become incapable of hiding my disdain for people who are dicks. Needless to say, self-loathing is an ongoing issue.
3. Every time I bend over to tie my shoes, there is an audible grunt- ing noise which seems to originate from just behind my uvula.
4. I’m shrinking.
5. I’m thickening.
6. I’ve started to floss in mixed company, unbothered by how rude that is.
7. The psychic struggle over the urge to urinate versus the need to sleep might be indicative of a brain tumor.
8. When strangers tell me their name I suffer some kind of mental blackout and have to carry on the conversation calling them “dude.”
9. I keep humming “What’s it all about, Alfie?” Even though I know the words!
10. I’ve developed a strange obsession regarding the making of lists. I feel driven to invent nonsensical things to make sure they’re ten items long.
For the record, I sent a strongly-worded letter detailing my concerns to Moderna. They have yet to respond."

For almost seventy years Warner Bros. was an iconic firm focused en- tirely on movies and television. Then, in 1989, it decided magazines were the next big thing and became Time Warner. In 1999, when I ar- rived, it thought the future was email and turned into Warner AOL. That didn’t go at all well, and it sheepishly reverted to being good ol’ Warner Bros. A few years later, some dude in a nice suit looked in a crystal ball and saw the future again. Phones. People waiting on line at the supermarket will watch movies and TV on their phones. So, with Uncle Sam’s reluctant approval, the sign on the street was changed to AT&T Warner Media. And now, because clearly the real money is in watching guys catch fish in bad weather, it’s about to be changed again. This time to Warner Bros. Discovery. But is that where it stops? Far be it from me to start any rumors that might rip- ple through Wall Street, but I was in the company cafeteria recently and overheard two well-dressed men whispering about yet another new moniker: Warner-Chipotle."

During the height of the pandemic, there were young women whose entire job was to walk around with six-foot-long sticks meant to remind us to stay a safe distance from each other. Several times a day, I’d be talking to the director, or an actor, or the cinematographer, when suddenly there was this stick being waved in my face. I had a running joke about it. I’d say I didn’t need the reminder, I could visualize six feet by imagining myself lying down and subtracting one inch. The stick women never laughed. Not once. Sometimes I wonder about them. What are they doing now? Are they chaperoning Catholic high school dances in 1959? And what about those sticks? I like to think they’re in a field somewhere, tied to tender saplings in order to brace them against stiff winds. And then, many years from now, those saplings will have grown into mighty trees that get chopped down to make six- foot-long sticks. And all thanks to COVID."

We seek power. It’s just what we do. Perhaps because we are the only animal that recognizes how utterly powerless it is. The only animal that has to live with the knowledge that, sooner or later, no matter how smart, talented, physically fit, beautiful, or wise, we will be snuffed out. So yes, we seek power. We seek it over time, the envi- ronment, the culture, and, most tragically, each other. It’s a form of madness, really. A psychotic fear of the inevitable transmuted into an endless game of King of the Mountain. Put another way, we are at war with reality, until we are at peace with mortality. Which begs the question, how does one arrive at that peace? How does one sniff the snuff with equanimity?

About five years ago a nice man from the phone company came to my of- fice and pitched his vision for the future of television - five to ten minute shows that people could watch, surprise surprise, on their phones. Without thinking, I blurted out, “Yeah, I’m not gonna do that.” (A few years later another nice man pitched the same idea over a fancy-schmancy Italian dinner. This time I didn’t say no quite so quickly. My mouth was full of thirty dollar pizza.) Now it appears yet another nice man might be coming to my office to present his take on what’s “comin’ ‘round the bend.” I’m gonna go out on a limb and guess it’s twenty minute sitcoms that sneak in subliminal tips on how to remodel a kitchen, or check for mold. But this time, because I’ve matured, I intend to be more thoughtful with my response. Maybe some- thing like, “Mold might be better addressed in a cop show.”"

Eight years ago we set out to make a comedy whose central theme was hope. Hope that recovery from alcoholism and addiction is possible. Hope that the journey can be filled with love, friendship and laugh- ter. Hope that people can change, mistakes can be forgiven, and shat- tered relationships can be healed. And finally, hope that life, through all its ups and downs, never has to be faced alone. So that was our goal. Our not-so-secret agenda. For one hundred and seventy episodes we wrapped jokes around hope. On behalf of everyone involved in the making of Mom, thank you for watching. Thank you for your sup- port. And, most importantly, thank you to all the men and women who have, for generations, carried the message: There is a solution."

I think it’s time to assign blame for our collective insanity. I don’t believe evolution is capable of creating a mad species. I choose to hang it on our culture. From my dilettante studies (Daniel Quinn), I’ve concluded that humanity was more or less rational when engaged in hunting and gathering. It’s murderous impulses - attacking neighboring tribes - were largely confined to protecting the local food supply and taking female hostages (to enlarge the gene pool and avoid the complications caused by first cousins bumping uglies). Hunter gatherers did not wipe out the environment or other species. It never occurred to them to forge an empire, or spread completely fictitious ideologies. So what changed? It began with farming. That was the Fall from Grace. The Eviction from Eden. To avoid the va- garies of weather, foraging and the hunt, Homo Sap shifted to the back-breaking work of clearing, sowing, and reaping. Suddenly we had surplus food. Full bellies procreate. Populations dramatically in- creased causing villages, towns, cities and nations to appear. With the breakdown of the tribal system, laws had to be invented to main- tain order amongst the suddenly diverse citizens. Which brings us to the creation of God. Or rather, the institutional version. Let’s call it God 2.0 - the “thou shalt not” iteration. Add mind-boggling technological advances that our frontal lobes have no capacity to en- gage with, and the result is a planet that is dominated by a seemingly wackadoodle mammal. So now you know. You’re not crazy. And neither is your neighbor. The problem lies in a culture that originated about ten thousand years ago. What can we do about it? I have no idea. Have a nice day."

Thank you. Wasn’t easy. I just came off a
run that lasted four years. Four years of mainlining Bill Maher and John Oliver. Four years of smoking a bowl of Maureen Dowd and Rachel Maddow. Four years of spewing and blathering my outrage at innocent bystanders. At people who were on my side. People who agreed with me!
The group laughs. They’ve been there.
CHUCK
Obviously I couldn’t talk to anyone who
didn’t agree with me. I mean, what’s the point? What comes after outrage? Outer-rage? But I’ve hit bottom. I’ve had to concede to my innermost self that I’m an addict. When I’m not outraged, I think about outrage, I seek out outrage. Sometimes, late at night, I’ll sneak downstairs to watch a rerun of Don Lemon. But, you know, one day at a time, and with the help of all of you, I’m recovering. I hope and pray that someday soon the obsession will be lifted and, by the grace of God, I’ll be able to watch cable news without screaming “ARE YOU $#€&!%@ KIDDING ME?!” Thank you.

(With apologies to Casey at the Bat)
             The smile was gone from Peter’s lip,
                a tear rolled down his cheek,
                 the COVID kept him distant,
week after lonely week.
So many years, he cheered us on, our happy hugging hero. Looking back, it now seems clear, Peter was patient zero.
               But long before the virus raged,
                   before the age of SVOD,
             a deal was struck, to reel in Chuck,
and pray he pleased the Les god.
A year went by,
then two, then three, Peter’s bet seemed a dead end. Until one day, CBS in May,
picked up Two and a Half Men.

                   an executive’s nirvana,

by the front window at Toscana.
A chardonnay, Mr. Roth?
Or how ‘bout a nice chianti? Something to go with the golden eggs,
laid by Greg Berlanti.
Retirement’s not an option, for men such as he. Peter’s thinking show biz, while he’s sitting down to pee.
He survived the crash of AOL, the CEO’s from Christmas past. He made himself a new deal, When Sarah Conner fell on her ass.
But can he give us the next Netflix? And we’d happily settle for half. That’s the question from the gentiles at, American Telephone & Telegraph.
            Oh, somewhere cop shows reign supreme,
                  and sitcoms are so witty,

Censorship is most effective when we become so intimidated, we start censoring ourselves. I have been doing that for some time now. I have been watering down these cards, and often these shows, because I didn’t want to be a target for all the anger out there. I didn’t want to be clickbait for meanness. (Hell, that last sentence is probably clickbait.) So consider this card a white flag. An unconditional surrender. For the last year I was afraid to inhale because of a virus. That should have been the least of my concerns. The current atmosphere is too toxic for an N95 mask. And there ain’t no vaccine to protect against ass%*&#s.

As you can see, this vanity card is number 666. The sign of the Devil. The mark of the beast. A bad street address to get preg- nant. Beelzebub aside, the number brings home the fact that I’ve been banging these things out for a very long time. For twenty- five years, they have allowed me to write about what amuses me, troubles me, befuddles me, and, maybe a little too often, pisses me off. Strangely, in all that time, no other TV producer has made an effort to use their vanity card as a written means of self-expres- sion. Which is why I’d like to take this opportunity to invite those folks to slap their thoughts onto the ass end of their shows and tell me - and you - what’s on their mind. Perhaps this could allow for a vibrant exchange of ideas that are only accessible by hitting pause on your remote. A word of warning! While it’s ini- tially a fun slash subliminal way to communicate, written vanity cards can quickly become a burden. People will give you backhanded compliments like, “I enjoy reading them even more than watching your little television show.” While other people will read them for the sole purpose of hating you. For the first group, you’ll feel obligated to keep writing in order to maintain that fragile, weekly, vaguely condescending relationship. For the second, your best response is no response. In the words of a great American poet, “...the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. Baby, I’m just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake. I shake it off, I shake it off, woo-hoo-hoo.”"

I’ve arrived at that time of life when it seems prudent to make arrangements for the disposition of my earthly remains. The two obvious options would be burial or cremation. (In the past, cer- tain indigenous peoples left their dearly departed out in the open, to be devoured by scavengers and bugs. This has a nice recycling vibe, but I worry there might be problems getting a permit.) Then it hit me. I could leave instructions to reduce my body to a gaseous state and placed in an aerosol container. This would allow for a funeral ceremony which ends with me being spritzed on the mourners. I’m still mulling this idea over, but for the moment, it feels like the right way to go. (Also might be nice to add a pleasant scent. Maybe vanilla or spicy apple.)"

As I get older, I find I am becoming prone to drone. Pontificat- ing, if you will. Bloviating, if that’s a verb. For reasons un- known, or perhaps just run-of-the-mill senility, I respond to both urgent and casual questions with long, dull responses. Even on Zoom, I can see people’s eyes glaze over as they politely nod, smile and wait for me to run out of air. It’s disheartening. I would like to be the soul of wit (brevity), but it’s just not an arrow in my cognitive quiver. Maybe it never was. Once I get go- ing, there’s no telling when I’ll shut up. Perhaps I should start warning people in advance. Say something like, “Are you sure you want to know how I’m doing? Because if you are, wait till you hear about my recent dentist visit. And how she, ever the concerned caregiver, expressed a desire to replace my old fillings. And how I jokingly told her that I preferred to wait until the price of silver went up. And how she stuffed cotton, clamps and saliva suc- tion devices in my mouth, presumably to assist in her ministra- tions, but more likely to keep me quiet.” Yeah, maybe that’s what I’ll do. Give people a heads-up that I’m inclined to go on and on. I could even offer them escape strategies. “Chuck, I’d really like to hear about how you found great-looking, fake wood shingles for your roof, but I have to go to Urgent Care and have my kidney stents rotated.” Or, “Chuck, I love your stories about the good old days of network sitcoms, when the business was dominated by co- caine-addled Harvard grads and cocaine-addled Jewish guys, but I have to unearth my dead mother and move her body to a more inclu- sive cemetery.”"

I know some dark stuff about our government and, of course, the clandestine world government which actually runs things. For obvi- ous reasons, I’m forbidden to disclose this information in a vanity card. But I can tell you that every day, at exactly 6 AM, a deep- state satellite emits a microwave burst of encrypted truth to a burner phone I have hidden on the Warner Brothers lot in Burbank. (Connect the dots - WB is owned by AT&T - a phone company.) I re- ceive these daily geo-synchronous reality packets because I’m part of a covert group of TV writers who’ve been tasked with imbedding top secret data (e.g. who’s a pedophile, who’s a cannibal, naming names and dietary restrictions) into network sitcoms and police procedurals. In order to understand the new world order, the real world order, you just have to watch our shows, paying strict atten- tion to the clever scene-ending jokes and startling third act plot twists. (If you don’t believe me, just ask anyone who works in television. They’ll tell you. Or they won’t, because they know what side their bread is buttered on - with ghee of course.) Re- gardless, I urge you to watch our shows to learn the truth. Keep- ing in mind that this is not the kind of truth that will set you free. If anything, it will piss you off. (But that’s okay, right? Deep down we want to be pissed off.)

Around twenty years ago, I was faced with what seemed like a simple choice, whether or not to participate in a nascent communication medium dubbed ‘social media’. At the time, the two most compelling options were Facebook and MySpace. Both were presented as an op- portunity to connect with people, particularly people from my past. I remember asking what, to me, seemed like a rational question, “If I feel the urgent need to connect, why can’t I use email? Or, heav- ens to murgatroyd, the phone?” Not surprisingly, those questions were met with a dismissive shake of the head. When an answer was condescendingly offered, it was something along the lines of, “These platforms will allow the whole world to reach out to you.” I was not reassured. In fact, I was horrified. The whole world? Wasn’t it clear that a small percentage of the whole world was stark raving mad? Why would I want to make myself available to millions of lunatics? People who, before the internet, could only communicate with ham radios and homemade signs at sporting events. And as far as me reaching out to the world, wasn’t I already doing just that via television? Anyway, my choice was simple. Twenty years ago, I consciously opted out of all forms of social media, and have remained so, to this day. I have no posts, stories, likes, reels, tweets, or TikToks. Nor am I being constantly as- saulted by any of those things. It is, to my way of thinking, a kind of peace. A refuge from the noise of humanity. #Ihavenoideawhat#means"

               MUNDANE CONCERNS IN THE TIME OF COVID
In the endless text chains that now constitute modern day communi- cation, I’ve started asking questions without bothering to use a question mark. Does that spell the end of the question mark
My iPhone has learned to recognize me with an N95 face mask on. Should I be concerned What else does it know How fast is it learning Can it see in the dark
There are COVID police where I work. When the pandemic ends, what will become of them Will they turn into a roving band of Mad Max- like characters who ruthlessly chase people down and swab their nostrils
Zoom. How important is it to see each other while having a conver- sation or meeting Do we really need visual confirmation that we exist And while we’re talking Zoom, the virtual backgrounds. Enough already.
If the Democratic leadership are all cannibalistic pedophiles, should they be required to wash their hands more than the rest of us
If and when the pandemic is over, will we continue to be tentative around each other, maintaining a safe distance, or will the entire world be thrust into a hugging frenzy that results in all of us be- ing called into Human Resources
And finally, I have long had bronchitis and allergies. This means I am prone to coughing and sneezing. When I feel one or the other coming on, I have been running out of the room to keep my col- leagues from having panic attacks. I’m not doing that anymore. Instead I will yell out, “pre-existing condition!” - then turn my elbow into a wet, bacterial hotspot.

I mean, c’mon. Wow. And what about Zoom? Thank god for that, right? Let’s see, what else... In no par- ticular order: Spaghetti. Napping. Music. A good book. Laughing. Tears of joy. Dogs, but not the tiny, yappy ones. Jeans that fit. Ice cream. A cool breeze on a warm summer night. Not having a clue what Tenet was about. Canada. Free long distance phone calls on the internet. Rooting for Elon Musk to go to Mars and come back. Star Wars, Star Trek, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and hopefully the upcoming Dune movie. And of course, the big three: love, family and community. (I purposely left out sex because discussing how or with who it should be done can be divisive — and I just turned 68, so who am I kidding.)

Much to my surprise, I’ve been instructed to return to work. The government has decided that writing sitcoms is an essential ser- vice. Yes, emerging from quarantine might put my health at risk, but the nation needs me. There are jokes that have to be written and, like it or not, somebody who isn’t a Harvard graduate has to do it. I’ve been called to a task that comedy writers have bravely shouldered since “Fibber McGee.” It’s my turn to shrug off the danger, sharpen my number two pencil, and deliver the glib.

It’s my understanding that the custom of shaking hands began as a way for two people to approach each other and show that neither was holding a weapon. In just a matter of days, that age-old ritual has come to an end, replaced by an odd display of boinking elbows and half-hearted waves. I would like to propose an alternative that maintains a hands-free, viral safe zone while simultaneously allowing strangers and friends to express their camaraderie. Back in the 1970’s there was a dance craze called “the bump,” wherein partners would “bump” their hips, buttocks or crotch against one another. I suggest we bring it back, sans disco music. Of course, in this hyper politically correct atmosphere, both greeters would have to clearly state the word “bump” beforehand. This could also be phrased as a question and answer. The first person would in- quire, “Bump?” Then the second person, assuming they felt physi- cally safe, would respond with an affirmative “Bump!” Now I real- ize that not every great idea catches on, so I have a back-up plan. As we approach someone, we hold our weapons in the air to alert each other not to come any closer."

I try to meditate every day. During the course of these meditations, I mostly sit quietly and observe my thoughts. There are a lot of them. Like mesothelioma commercials, they just keep coming. If I were to estimate, I’d say that ninety percent are, in one form or another, about defending my ego. The remaining ten percent have to do with everyday minutiae; e.g. making a mental note to find someone who can figure out why my Nest thermostat hates me, or wondering if I’m emotionally equipped to buy thermal underwear online. But getting back to that corrosive ninety percent. What is this ego exactly? It can’t be my body. If I were to lose an arm, my sense of self would not be diminished. In fact, it might be perversely enlarged when I start calling myself Captain Chuck Hook. So what is it then? Is there anything substantial that can be pointed at? The answer, clearly, is no. The ego is an illusion. A dream of is-ness. Which explains the almost constant mental noise. You can’t defend what doesn’t exist. All you can do is obsessively worry, resent, justify, and rationalize over it. In other words, the aforementioned ninety percent. One can only wonder what life might be like if we could truly rest in that knowledge. Imagine selfhood being synonymous with cosmic consciousness. Other than that ten percent of the time when we’re so pissed off by the AC running at full blast we finally summon the courage to buy long johns on our iPhone, we’d be pretty serene."

For the first time in history, we are not dying in huge numbers as a result of war, starvation and plague. We are dying of old age. And even that's being challenged.* But lucky does not equal happy. Staggering amounts of food and breathtaking advances in medicine and technology do not result in peace of mind. In fact, for some perverse reason, the level of misery, discontent and irritability seems to be at an all-time high. Which is why I respectfully propose the following solution.

"Dec 12th, 2019","The loss of faith is a terrible thing. To believe in something with absolute certainty, and then cease to believe, is an almost unbearable experience. For my entire life I believed in the common sense of America. Sure the pendulum might swing to the right, but then it would always swing back to the left - ultimately finding its way to the moderate, American, middle. That naive faith is gone. I see now the inherent madness in not just Americans, but in all human beings. A madness based on our willingness to believe in whatever fiction best comforts us.* Or enrages us. I can only suppose we're wired this way because life, the world, reality, is simply too much. In the face of overwhelming uncertainty, we desperately seek some ground to stand on, even if that ground does not actually exist. We live, love, fight and die defending sandcastles. No, not even. The idea of sandcastles. The dream of sandcastles. All while an actual wave approaches.

Regardless of our genetic makeup, we are always being reborn in response to our physical maturation, our family, our community, our friends, our husbands, our wives, and our education. And perhaps most importantly, we are continually being reborn as the result of pain - both physical and emotional. After all, what shapes and changes us more than pain? What forces us to evolve? And if we follow that path, we must inevitably come to the final birthing process: death. For how can a lifetime of endless reemergence end? The answer is, it can't If the universe is a forever flowing river of information, how can we arrogantly believe we are standing on the shore? We may not be us after death, but we are not not. Anyway, that's my latest thinking on the subject.

In each episode we follow the adventures of five people who have surrendered their dignity and integrity -- their souls, if you will -- in exchange for power and prestige. This dark deal causes them to have split personalities. In public they are proud, strong and sophisticated. But behind closed doors, when they're near the ""source"" of their power, they grovel like a labradoodle who just took a dump on the brand new living room carpet and knows he's in big trouble.The characters:ROUND MIKE: So named to avoid confusion with Long Mike, Round Mike has spent his life in public service and has generally shown strength of character and principled discernment. For this reason his former associates are puzzled by his eagerness to be ""buns up kneelin'"" while a life-long criminal stands behind him ""wheelin' and dealin'.""* Some speculate that he unconsciously craves a strong father becuase his real dad was a tapeworm. Others insist his spinelessness is simply the result of extortion. (There have long been rumors of a video showing him dancing on a mirror in order to ""check out"" his junk.) LONG MIKE: As with Round Mike, a sobriquet to avoid confusion in the war room. Long Mike is a conniving, venal guy who is constantly climbing over both friends and foes to achieve his secret dream -- world domination. There is nothing he won't do to accomplish hi evil ends -- except have dinner with Margaret Atwood. CRYPT KEEPER KELLY: So named becuase that's the vibe she gives off. Like Long Mike, CKK will do or say anything to stay in the slimelight. And she's tough as nails. She can withstand and kind of criticism. She's not even bothered when her husband kisses her and throws up in his mouth. LINDSEY LOVELAVE: A southern gentleman who acquired the Lovelace name because... well, you know why. RUDOLF THE BROWN-NOSED LAWYER: Like Round Mike, Rudolf was once a stand-up guy. But somewhere along the way, he was driven mad by fame, money and a deep need to be pretty. *Dinah-Moe Humm"" by Frank Zappa"

"May 9th, 2019","People prefer to be right. Right feels good. Itâs empowering. Wrong feels awful. And this is by design. Evolution rewards being right and punishes being wrong. The foraging monobrows who looked up from the berry bush and said, âThatâs a predator, run away,â had a better chance of passing on their genes than the Alley Oops who said, âNo, itâs just a big pussycat with an unfortunate overbite.â (They were more likely to become virgins tartare.) In other words, wrong equals death. If youâre wrong enough, you get excused from the planet. This explains why itâs almost impossible to change peopleâs minds. In order to have a shift in perspective, one must first admit to being wrong. Thatâs extremely hard to do. History is filled with people who chose to cause unbelievable carnage rather than consider the possibility that theyâve misjudged a situation (Iâm talking about you Imperial Japan, Deutschland Ã¼ber alles, and The Confederate States of America). Which is why I fear for our future. None of us are willing to be wrong. The very idea of it is inconceivable. Unless, of course, some enlightened soul came along and proposed an alternative to the polarity of right and wrong. Perhaps the idea of Neither. A middle way leading to peace, serenity and joy. And if we were again to use history as a guide, we would most likely decide the Enlightened One was wrong, then we would kill Him, then we would worship Him, then we would kill anyone who didnât agree that ours was the true faith.

Scratching brings temporary relief, which is always followed by worse itching. Left alone, however, most itches simply vanish. This is no simple feat. To leave an itch unattended, one has to experience the itch in real time. That requires suspension of judgement. The itch is neither good nor bad. Pleasant or awful. It simply is.

I mean no one. But Stan just kept plugging away. He was like if Willy Loman was irrepressibly upbeat and sold superheroes. Iâd like to say that at the time I saw his persistence as admirable.

Like in the classic sci-fi novel A Canticle For Leibowitz, each card would be studied, pondered and argued over by hermetic monks who fervently believe them to be documents of divine origin. In this imagined future, chaste and smelly men in threadbare woolen robes happily devote their entire lives trying to understand the entirely not esoteric words of me. And this would go on for thousands of years. Generation after generation of completely misguided wisdom seekers would write treatises on pointless essays that I wrote in a hurry (like this one). Even this card, which debunks the entire notion that there is anything of value in the previous five hundred and ninety-nine cards, would be analyzed for clues. And best of all, when no mountaintop epiphany occurs, when no transcendent revelation rips through their consciousness, my spiritual descendants, my acolytes would still believe. Because to acknowledge theyâd been misled or fooled would be unthinkable. As a general rule, people prefer to be blind than stupid. So yeah, thatâs my fantasy. And while I admit it betrays some wild-ass hubris on my part, I donât see any real harm in it. Heck, in a world of infinite possibilities, where fiction and worship are often two sides of the same shekel, it could even happen. But in the meantime, this is my six hundredth vanity card.

Laughing at the human condition, at the shared minutiae of life, suddenly felt like a shallow luxury, a mindless distraction from this toxic cloud that enveloped and poisoned everything. But what other choice was there? Get up in the morning and do... what? Write drama? (Lordy, can you imagine the faces of my bosses at Warner Bros. if I told them I wanted to write drama? I can. Their eyes are wide and theyâre smiling and nodding, but if you listen closely you can hear their sphincters tighten.) Doesnât really matter. I couldnât write drama anyway. In second grade my teacher Miss Gosden told my parents I was the class clown, and perhaps I wasnât getting enough attention at home. Nothingâs changed. Anyway, not seeing any other options, comedy was written this year. Comedy was performed, directed, produced and edited.

I think this is the reason my song-writing career peaked at, ""They're the world's most fearsome fighting team, they're heroes on a half shell and they're green."" But more importantly, my creative defect has caused me to live with a dirty little secret -- I don't really get classical or pop poetry. When Bob Dylan sang, quite assertively, that ""the answer was blowin' in the wind,"" I knew it was not. The only thing blowin' in the wind was wind, dirt, leaves and miscellaneous crap light enough to become temporarily airborne. Not that I could share this with anyone. It was not for me to question the voice of my generation. But privately I always thought it would have been a better song if he simply told us what the 'answer' was. (""How many roads must a man walk down, before they could call him a man?"" Nine. Six if he jogs.) The reason I bring this up is that I aspire to break free from the confines of logic. I yearn to write thought-provoking, surrealistic sojourns into the realm of the unfettered spirit. I dream that just once, the muses will infuse my soul with graceful poetry that speaks to the heart. That my ""Blowin' in the Wind"" will not be the cheap punch line to a dirty joke that I tried to sneak past the network censor."

"Apr 26th, 2018","Recently I was scrolling through the contacts list in my cell phone, when I came across an entry of a casual acquaintance who had died. This was a very nice person, someone I enjoyed spending time with. There was no real reason we didnât become closer friends. Just the usual excuses, busy lives, and tossed-off promises of lunches and dinners that would never come to pass. Anyway, here was all this personâs contact information - email, phone numbers, etc. Was I supposed to delete it? I couldnât think of a reason not to, but pressing the delete button seemed disrespectful, almost irreverent. To die is one thing, to be deleted quite another. Instead, I took a deep breath and called the number. It went to voicemail (thank God). I then left a rambling message about how I wished weâd gotten to know each other better, and that I was sorry I didnât follow up on one of our many threatened lunch dates. It was a silly thing to do, but when I hung up I felt a small bit of closure. Then my phone rang. I looked down and saw his name in the caller ID. I froze. The room started to spin. My heart was pounding in my ears. I took a deep breath, forced myself to press the accept button and put the phone to my ear. It was his son. He was confused as to why Iâd called his late father. I promised to explain it over a lunch. Date, TBD."
"Apr 12th, 2018","To Whom It May Concern: If you were troubled that a Ramones cover song from 1993 was on the radio in the comic book store even though the show is set in 1989, I understand. Normally we would never do something like that, but the truth is I got excited by the lyrics âSomeone told me long ago, thereâs a calm before the stormâ and how they foreshadowed the tornado. I also liked the rebellious tone the Ramones set in a store that Mary felt was inappropriate for Sheldon. To help rationalize this musical anachronism, I asked our showâs science consultant, Dr. David Saltzberg, for help. I learned that in Richard Feynmanâs PhD thesis, he had a theory of âAdvanced Potentialsâ which stated radio waves could travel the wrong direction in time. As far as why this particular radio can receive them, Iâve decided it was due to a freak accident in 1985 involving a spilled can of New Coke during a thunderstorm at a screening of Back to the Future. I hope that now knowing science and a cool origin story are involved, your mind will be set at ease. Sincerely, Steve Molaro P.S. If youâre also wondering how a Joey Ramone cover from 2002 got in at the end, I donât knowâ¦ heâs from Queens and so am I â what do you want from me?"

"Mar 29th, 2018","One of the greatest honors of my life was directing a scene for The Big Bang Theory featuring Stephen Hawking. Try as I might, there was no way to prepare for an event like that. Iâve met some pretty smart people making sitcoms, but none of them would rank as a once-in-a-generation, paradigm-shifting genius (okay, maybe Jon Cryer). I also had never met someone trapped in a totally unresponsive body (insert gratuitous ex-wife joke here). When I was first introduced to Professor Hawking, one of his assistants lifted his hand in order for me to shake it. I was told that while he cannot move his hand, he can feel and enjoy the touch of other people. I remember thinking how this might explain that whole business with the nurse. I then told him that I tried reading A Brief History of Time, but sadly could not understand a word of it. My honesty was rewarded when his eyes lit up. His assistant whispered to me that when nonscientists tell him they enjoyed the book, he knows theyâre lying. After a few more nervous, dim-witted pleasantries, âYou know the Rose Bowl Parade goes right by here,â it came time for me to direct the scene between him and Jim Parsons. Looking back, I think I can safely say the material played well. The story worked, the jokes all scored. But I will be forever tormented by the memory of how the scene began. I looked down at Stephen Hawking, frozen in that chair, and, to my horror, my mouth said, âAction!â Thankfully, my poor choice of word only rattled me. Professor Hawking would guest star on the show many more times over the years. And while thereâs no way for a civilian like me to even remotely appreciate his intellect, I can tell you what I came to understand about the man: Stephen Hawking had a fierce sense of humor. Especially about himself. His willingness to laugh, despite the enormous difficulties he faced, was part of his genius."

"Feb 1st, 2018","Once again I was snubbed by the Grammys. And donât tell me itâs because I didnât release an album last year. âCause I didnât. Youâd think the fact that Iâve met Grammy president Neil Portnow on several occasions would count for something. Yeah, youâd think. Iâm just glad I wasnât there. Overcome by bitterness, I probably wouldâve run on stage and caused a scene - wrestling that little gramophone thing away from Bruno Mars. Well, itâs all blood under the bridge now. Nothing left to do but fly to Stockholm and be ignored by the Nobel committee. Again."
"Jan 18th, 2018","When I was a little boy I was constantly worried about myself and my family being killed by an atom bomb. Air raid drills and hiding in underground shelters were an almost daily part of my young life. (Remove all pens, pencils and sharp objects from your breast pocket, take off your glasses, look away from the window, find a buddy, hold hands, no talking, walk quickly to the basement, get on your knees, place your head against the wall, wait for the all-clear signal, hope the teacher forgets about the arithmetic test you didn't study for.) Looking back, it was a ridiculously traumatic way to grow up. But like so many awful things, you got used to it. The fear of instant annihilation was just always there, lurking in the background. Until it wasn't. Somehow, over time, the inevitability of the mushroom cloud simply went away. Wise and prudent men in our country and others, found a better way to exercise their hatred and fear of each other's social and economic system. Until now. Now the wise and prudent men are no more, and the unthinkable is back on the table. Death and suffering on an unimaginable scale is once again an option. The low drumbeat of existential dread has returned, and I find myself thinking odd thoughts, like: ""I hope someone reminds him that he can't play golf in a Hazmat suit."""
"Jan 11th, 2018","In the 1980's, Ronald Reagan deregulated children's TV programming. This allowed large toy companies to finance the production of thousands of hours of shows that were designed to sell toys. Rather than be educated and/or simply entertained, this very vulnerable audience could now be exploited for financial gain. Bad for kids, but good for me. Reagan's mostly unheralded policy shift created an enormous demand for scripts, which allowed me to get my first job in television. In a matter of months, I went from struggling musician to gainfully employed scriptwriter. My life dramatically changed for the better, (comedically changed for the better?), because a Republican president decided the pursuit of profit need not be hindered by the common good. I've always felt a bit ambivalent about this. For many years I've wondered if my success came at a price. Were children growing up in the 1980's somehow harmed by the cynical, thirty-minute commercials that suddenly engulfed the after-school hours and all of Saturday morning? Well, wonder no longer. If thirty-two-year-old, White House advisor Stephen Miller is any indication, the damage done to some of those kids was deep and irreparable."
"Jan 4th, 2018","There is an almost perpetual gap between my expectations as to how things should be and the way things actually are. This space, or divide, causes me a considerable amount of discomfort, which I try to alleviate through the use of repetitive thoughts, as well as spoken and written words. This activity is called ""complaining."" The fact that it rarely accomplishes anything, other than exacerbate my irritation, does not keep me from engaging in it. Furthermore, it appears that buried deep within my psyche is the firmly held conviction that complaining is therapeutic - even though experience shows again and again that it's not. In other words, I have a false belief that appears to be immutable, which drives me to take an action that only makes matters worse... and I like it. My only consolation is the knowledge that I come from a long line of complainers. One of my fondest childhood memories is looking up at the adult relatives gathered around the kitchen table, the men smoking Pall Malls, the women smoking Newports, everyone eating smoked fish, and all of them talking over each other, loudly bitching and moaning about pretty much everything. I remember that a rant would often end with the resigned, self-deprecating, seemingly rhetorical question, ""Oh, well, who am I to complain?"" Well, these many years later, it turns out it's not rhetorical. And I now know the answer. This is my birthright. Who am I if I don't complain?"
"Dec 21st, 2017","A Holiday Apology My politically slanted vanity cards have upset many people. For this I am profoundly sorry. TV comedies are meant to provoke laughter, not ire. Please know that going forward I will endeavor to keep this space clear of anything biased or provocative. I want my work to be a sanctuary, a safe place where we come together. Each half hour should offer a brief, hopefully humorous, respite from divisive and inflammatory rhetoric. So, once again, to those of you who have taken issue with my comments, I apologize. I hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me. Regretfully yours, Chuck Lorre P.S. Hmmm, that's enough. You get the idea. P.P.S. No wait, just one more thing.

"Dec 14th, 2017","Back in the sixties when Star Trek debuted, you couldn't help but notice that the bridge of the Starship Enterprise was a multi-cultural, multi-national, multi-intelligent species sort of arrangement. It portrayed, to my impressionable young mind, an inevitable kumbaya, pluralistic future. It's only lately that I've come to understand how naive that world view was. I now see that human nature, particularly during times of stress, becomes tribalistic, not pluralistic. Which is neither good nor bad. It's probably just how we're wired, a survival mechanism baked into our DNA. Under pressure, the prime directive is to protect the tribe. Genetically, that makes perfect sense. Human beings without a tribe tend to starve or get eaten. Now I don't want to cast aspersions, or ""throw shade"" as the kids like to say, but I would like to point out one thing I find painfully obvious: He's not in your tribe. He's not in my tribe. In fact, if you look closely, you'll see he belongs to no tribe. And he never really has. Make of that what you will."
"Dec 7th, 2017","Every once in a while I like to take a moment and reminisce about my early years growing up in the hardscrabble, New England fishing village of Stymie, Massachusetts. The citizens of Stymie were a simple folk, mostly uneducated Kelvanese immigrants whose lives revolved around what they liked to call the three F's: fishing, fornicating and fighting. One of my fondest memories was the night I pulled off what the locals called the Stymie Trifecta. At seven PM I caught a two-hundred-pound grouper with nothing but my bare hands and a stick of dynamite. At ten o'clock I had relatively safe sex in the backseat of an abandoned AMC Pacer with my second cousin Devonatella. And just before midnight I punched it out with a one-eared, welterweight pastry chef from the neighboring town of Dimple. (The brouhaha ended when I landed a decisive blow on what would, or should, have been his left ear.) Now I know what you're probably thinking, this all seems a mite implausible, like a bit of a yarn, a bunch of hokum. All I can say is next time you're up around North Helmsley-by-the-Bracken, take the Shemphead Highway over to Stymie and ask around. You'll see it all happened exactly as I described. One word of warning: If you pass through Dimple, best not to bring up the fight at the local bakery. Like stereophonic music, it's a sore subject."

"Nov 16th, 2017","In hindsight, it seems obvious that the final conquest of the United States came about, not as a result of war and invasion, but simply because so many notable Americans were purchasable. History books, if any legitimate ones get written, will someday explain how those in leadership roles, both in and out of government, all had a price. Which, when you think about it, makes a heartbreaking kind of sense. From its inception, our national culture has been predicated on the ruthless pursuit of profit. Sure we all enjoy movies, books and TV shows that portray people putting principles ahead of personal gain. But it might be time to admit that in the real world, grandiose patriotism has always been a mask used to hide banal self-interest. Regardless, the sale is complete. Cash, not Kalashnikovs, sealed the deal."

"Dec 8th, 2016","I believe we are not by nature flawed. To believe that we are is the ultimate narcissism. It would mean that out of all creation, we, and only we, are inherently broken. Instead, I have come to believe that western culture, beginning ten thousand years ago with communal agriculture, is the thing that is flawed.* When humankind abandoned hunting and gathering, and began to work the land is when it fell from grace. It is when we were expelled from Eden and began our endless search for meaning. When tribes became villages, became towns, became cities, became nations, is when we descended into insanity. The destruction that followed required us to invent laws and wrathful gods to curb the madness. But we are not by nature mad. We were driven to behave madly by a culture we created and then forgot we were in. Which raises the question, what now? A return to foraging doesn't seem like much of an option. The wisdom needed to support that lifestyle took thousands of years to accumulate and is now long forgotten. Perhaps a constructive first step might be to simply acknowledge that the fabric of our existence is badly torn. And that the tear began long ago, when we lost faith in the world. When we decided this miraculous garden would not, or could not, provide. Step two would be embracing the fact that there's nothing inherently wrong with us, that we are masterpieces of biological engineering. And step three... well, that would be a new way of thinking. One that is not sickened by a zero-sum culture. Sadly, if you're reading this, you will not be the one thinking those new thoughts. You probably won't even recognize them when they come. If anything, they will appear as a threat to you. And just to be clear, I include myself in this group. We are all hopelessly shackled to the old way of thinking. Perhaps a child is being born right now who will make the breakthrough. Or perhaps it will emerge from some form of artificial intelligence. In the meantime... gee, I don't know, I guess we watch sitcoms. * Special thanks to Daniel Quinn."
"Dec 1st, 2016","I don't know about you, but I've been spending most of my free time in the land of Not Yet. If you're unfamiliar with it, Not Yet is a happy place where all the bad things that seem likely to occur have not happened... yet. I like to think of it as a shimmering, shivering soap bubble whose fragile beauty is only made greater by the knowledge that it will soon burst, making way for the dark realm of You Gotta Be Kidding Me. But not now. Not Yet. And yes, I would love to say Not Ever, but that place doesn't exist."
"Nov 24th, 2016","For  the  sake  of  my  mental  health  I  am  taking  a  break  from  watching TV  news.    I  am  also  avoiding  newspapers  and  news  websites.    I  am, for  better  or  worse,  sticking  my  head  in  the  sand.    I  have  no choice.    Continued  engagement  with  current  events  is  just  too painful.    I  will  instead  fill  my  time  with  friends,  family,  music, meditation,  golf,  novels,  sports  and  movies.    And  yes,  I  could  be accused  of  apathy,  of  being  a  sulky  sore  loser.    And  perhaps  I am.    I  don't  care.    I  need  some  time  to  regroup.    To  allow  my  grief and revulsion  to  morph  into  something  positive.    Something productive.    Sitting  around  and  worrying  about  the  global  rise  of fascism is so 1938."

"Oct 27th, 2016","You can laugh at the human predicament. You can laugh at yourself. You can laugh because the alternative is crying. You can laugh because a truism has been exposed. You can laugh at the weakness, stupidity and failures of others. You can laugh because you identify. You can laugh to be polite. You can laugh from surprise. You can laugh from nervousness. You can laugh at the futility of it all. You can laugh at the antics of animals. You can laugh because it hurts. You can laugh because others are laughing. You can laugh at tragedy if enough time has passed. You can laugh at the statement, ""This is no laughing matter."" I could go on, but clearly there are many reasons to laugh. As a fun homework assignment, I encourage you to look for others, write them down and don't send them to me."

"Oct 10th, 2016","Barack Obama taught me how to smile. Perhaps I should explain. I've been lucky enough to have met and had my picture taken with the President on several occasions. Politics aside, it's an amazingly cool thing to spend a moment with a man who is a living part of history. (And no matter what your politics, you have to be a little grateful that history didn't end during his tenure.) Anyway, the smile. Each time I received my ridiculously expensive, suitable-for-framing photograph of me and the POTUS, there I'd be, staring into the camera with a tight-lipped, rictus grin stitched into my face. And there he'd be, hand dangling loosely over my shoulder, with an ear-to-ear smile that showed a whole lot of gleaming teeth. And guess who looked better? Guess who looked like he was having a good time? There was no question that I needed to make some changes, beginning with a tube of whitening toothpaste. Then I had to practice that smile in front of a camera. At first the whole toothy thing felt strange and forced. I was sure I looked like an escapee from a mental institution who had been interrupted while devouring a squirrel. But the results were unquestionable. Despite how I might have been feeling, I almost always looked as if I was happy and relaxed. All of which explains why his term in office might be coming to a close, but I will keep his smile with me forever."
"Oct 3rd, 2016","Every now and then I feel the need to remind viewers that this show is filmed in front of a live studio audience. It is their laughter you hear on your TV. There is no ""laugh track."" We do not add artificial or ""canned"" laughs. If something isn't funny our job is to make it funny, not pretend it is. If anything, on occasion we will actually tone down studio audience laughter because it drowns out the dialogue. We have also been deleting their ""oohs,"" ""ahhhs,"" and ""ohhhs"" because it triggers Nickelodeon flashbacks in Steve Molaro."
"Sep 26th, 2016","I've thought long and hard about this vanity card. What I'm about to say is going to upset quite a few people. Some of them are my friends. Or perhaps, after reading this, my former friends. But I can't let that stop me from speaking my mind. It's time to say out loud what I know in my heart to be true. Vegetarians and vegans are mobility bigots. They believe that if a life form doesn't move, it's fair game to be killed and eaten. They hold a deepseated prejudice against plants, or, as plants prefer to be called, ""We Who Stand Still."" This hateful philosophy is predicated on the idea that movement equals consciousness, or, if you will, a certain level of sacredness. To put it simply, if it walks, flies, or swims, or comes from something that does, it should not be ingested. If it doesn't, yum-yum. Of course when you ask vegetarians and vegans, they say no, they're only opposed to eating flesh. But what could be more fleshy than a mushroom? Or avocado? Or eggplant? The ugly truth is they are cowards who murder and devour anything that can't run away. These people, who act so high and mighty, so spiritually elevated, have somehow constructed a style of cuisine that would justify them eating my Uncle Murray, a man known for sitting still for hours at a time, staring at a TV that is turned off. So the next time you order a salad consider this: Prince told us that doves cry. But what if kale does too?"
"Sep 19th, 2016","In an effort to encourage transparency among those who seek high office, I am releasing my dogs medical records.

"May 19th, 2016","Thank you for watching the season finale of Mom. We are all deeply grateful for your support. That being said, I've been told by some worried Warner Bros. executives that the show does not do as well with men as it does with women. As you can imagine, this is cause for concern. From the very first episode, our purpose was to cause laughter and, when appropriate, touch on some serious subjects. It was never our intent to exclude an entire gender. So where did we go wrong? Is it possible that the title ""Mom"" pushed male viewers away? Should we have named the show, ""Alcoholic Nymphos""? Seems a little extreme. Perhaps we should consider starting next season with a series of wacky yet heartbreaking episodes featuring drug-addled porn stars, and the Ferrari-driving, gun-toting NFL players who love them? Hmmm... maybe. Or we can simply continue to make the show we love and the show we're proud of, knowing that nothing good ever came from pandering to peoples baser instincts. Except for Two and a Half Men, that was pretty good."
"May 16th, 2016","I have somehow stumbled onto a magic spell. It consists of three words that have changed my life for the better. And here, faithful vanity card reader, are those words: I don't know. Now before you get upset by their unremarkable quality, their lack of faux Latin, Harry Potter mumbo jumbo-ness, I'd like you to try a little experiment. Say the following out loud: ""I don't know what tomorrow will bring. I don't know how long I will live. I don't know how my smart phone works. I don't know how my body works. I don't know how pretty much anything works. I don't know how we got here. I don't know where we're headed. I don't know what I don't know. I don't know why I'm doing this, considering how unlikely it is that Chuck Lorre knows anything of consequence."" Okay, well done! Now that we've established your lack of knowing, a vacuum of sorts has been created. And what do we all know about vacuums? Nature abhors them. So it stands to reason that something will rush in to fill that vacuum. And something does. I don't know what it is. I just know it's magic."

"May 9th, 2016","I'm thirteen years old, jammed in the backseat of a Chevy Impala. My uncle is driving. My aunt is in the passenger seat. My parents are in the back with me. The four adults are talking about where they ate last night. This then leads to what they ate, then to the quality of the food, then to queries about other restaurants they may or may not have eaten in. I remember thinking that when I grew up I would never be that boring, that shallow. Fifty years later. I'm driving my car. (I paid retail for it, so I won't mention the manufacturer.) There are three other adults in the car as well. The conversation is about food. Where we ate, what we ate, how was it, and have we ever eaten at such and such restaurant. As the discussion goes on around me, I can't help thinking that I have betrayed my teenage oath. I've become the banal grownup I once decried. Anxious to regain my self-respect, I abruptly switch the topic to something more consequential. I choose the threat of antibiotic-resistant staph infections. My companions are startled. One asks what that has to do with polenta. I can't figure out a way to explain my long ago, silent vow so I angrily exclaim, ""Everything!"" The rest of the drive to the restaurant happens in silence."
"May 9th, 2016","Sometimes I begin writing a vanity card with no idea what I'm writing about. I don't recommend this. What usually happens is I wind up with a collection of sentences that have a vague linear trajectory, but no real purpose. In some ways it's like all the high school and college essay exams where I purposely tried to hide my lack of preparation behind a voluminous cascade of impressive sounding words. My theory was that a thick stack of single-spaced, purple prose would be so off-putting to the teacher, he or she would slap a 'C' on the paper in order to avoid wading through a lot of cursive bull$#!+. Needless to say, the short, succinct style of these vanity cards forestalls that exact approach, but I am hopeful it still has the power to distract. Sonorous fodder like, ""vague linear trajectory,"" ""voluminous cascade,"" ""forestall,"" and ""sonorous fodder"" are all used to just that end. Which raises the question: Why? What compels me to obfuscate? Sadly, I have no good answer. I do have a bad one. I take a childish delight in wasting your time. I know that's setting the bar pretty low, but keep in mind, at an early age I was happy to get a 'C'."

"May 2nd, 2016","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #111*       <br/><br/>    This is the official ""I have nothing worth writing about"" vanity card. It will run whenever I have nothing worth writing about. Don't be surprised to see it quite a bit. From now on, when our schedule requires me to deliver a new card and I'm empty, I'll simply say, ""Run one-eleven."" A check of the one hundred and ten cards I've already written will quickly demonstrate that I should have written this card a long time ago. Why didn't I? Vanity. I had become vain about my vanity cards. I was determined to write a new one each week because, well... I'm just that kind of guy. But I'm older and wiser now. I know when I have nothing to say. And that knowledge is freedom. Freedom from the constant need to win your approval. And more importantly, freedom from the obsessive and relentless need to end each vanity card on a joke.

Sometimes I wonder why I'm always putting my t-shirt on backwards when there's a fifty-fifty chance I'll get it right. Sometimes I wonder why people vote against their self-interest. Sometimes I wonder why I vote against my self-interest. Sometimes I wonder why people who believe in an omnipotent, allknowing, eternal and infinite God of love can be angry.

"Apr 14th, 2016","I am, by any reasonable measurement, old. And yet, more often than not, I feel ageless. Not young, mind you. Ageless. Without age. Nevertheless, the two things create a sort of cognitive dissonance -- when the fact of something doesn't sync up with the experience of it. Of course, it's possible that what I'm feeling is the fact. Ageless is some kind of basic spiritual truth, and being old is simply an experience that we choose to have. We could, for instance, pee often and slowly; make odd, involuntary grunting noises while getting out of a chair; have difficulty seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, copulating, remembering, bending our fingers and breathing, while remaining a field of awareness that exists outside the illusion of time. We also could complain all day and take lots of naps. As I said, it's a choice."
"Apr 7th, 2016","It's time for me to come clean. I'm the guy who helped the FBI hack the iPhone. Why did I do it? I don't know, why do people climb mountains? The standard answer is, because they're there (although I've long believed that mountain climbers have loveless marriages that force them out of the house and into a Sherpa). How did I hack the iPhone? To be completely honest, like many gamechanging breakthroughs, it was an accident. I was actually fooling around in the kitchen, trying to make a meatloaf sandwich without using my hands. Why am I coming out with this story now? Well, that's a tougher question. The truth is, I didn't want to, but my lawyers encouraged me to get ahead of the lurid tabloid stories that will be coming out shortly (my hands were not ""otherwise engaged""). To set the record straight, my motive for assisting the FBI was simple patriotism. I never had any desire to profit from my discovery. Ever the altruist, I will use the fruit of my hightech chicanery to help the wives of mountaineers break into their husbands' iPhones while they recover from ""altitude sickness."
"Apr 7th, 2016","I don't mean to offend anyone, but God told me to write this vanity card. The following are His words. I just took dictation. Dear Humanity, You are all animated by me.

Some awareness plays soaring piano concertos, some shoots three from the perimeter, some drive around in little cars looking for parking violations. It's still me. Just in a different guise. God in drag, if you will. Simply put, each and every one of you is a perfect expression of my timeless, universe-straddling ineffability. You are also meaningless and inconsequential. It's a paradox, I know. But only to you. Which brings me to the purpose of this vanity card. In your endless quest to forge an identity, you have lost sight of what you are. So I will say it again. When you strip away all the temporary labels - American, Iranian, Israeli, Russian, Chinese, young man, old woman, soldier, florist, gay, straight, rich, poor, liberal, conservative, Muslim, Christian, Hindu or Jew - when those identities are taken away, and believe me, they eventually will be, then all that is left of you... is me. Consider this the next time you feel compelled to hurt or kill someone. Look at them. See me. Then act. On a lighter note, I've just been loving this season of Mom.

"Mar 10th, 2016","As some of you might know, I have long avoided having any social media presence. I am completely ignorant of all things Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and whatever other cyberforum the teenage cognoscenti have recently anointed. I know the pound sign is a crucial element to communicating via Twitter, but have never personally tried it. More importantly, I don't feel like I'm missing anything. My life doesn't feel lesser for it. When I began these vanity cards almost twenty years ago, I decided that they were a perfectly adequate way of communicating my personal thoughts on a large scale. Sure, they're a one-way communication, but I actually prefer that. My thinking was, and still is, that this world of ours already sends too many messages. Or perhaps consciousness, by its very nature, acquiesces to being barraged. Either way, my self-preservation seemed to demand digital inaccessibility. Or, to put it more simply, the only hater I can tolerate in my head is already in my head."

From the moment she opened her eyes she knew something was amiss. It was like she had a sixth sense that was olfactory adjacent. Ennui rolled over in bed so she was nose to nose with her sleeping husband, Weltschmerz. She thought about waking him, alerting him to whatever unknown danger was out there. But he was so weary lately. As if the world was just too much for him. So she did nothing. Not out of love. The whole thing just suddenly felt boring and pointless."
"Jan 14th, 2016","President Roosevelt famously said, ""...the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself."" Now, let's take a moment and ask ourselves, which presidential candidates and cable news networks are actively promoting fear? Which one of these people and corporate entities are determined to scare your pants off, in the hope that you'll either vote for them or stay tuned? Or let's approach this from a different angle. After millions of years of evolution, or six days of divine creation, it doesn't really matter which, our brains are wired to seek out danger and respond accordingly. Fight or flight or, if it's not trying to eat you, negotiate. It makes sense then, that presenting a threat to our survival is a time-tested way to get the brain's attention. And let's be clear about one thing; attention is the most valuable commodity in the world. Once you have someone's attention you can sell them something, or, if you're the kind of person who is frightened of self-determined people, control them - while reassuring them that your only concern is their right to be self-determined. (This is not to say that there aren't people who have ample reason to be afraid. I'm just gonna go out on a limb and say you're probably not one of them.) So the real question to ask yourself is not who or what should you be afraid of, it's how are you doing right now. Go ahead. Ask yourself. Are you in jeopardy right now? Of course not. You're squinting at this vanity card and perhaps wondering if there's a clever joke at the end of it. (Spoiler alert: there is not.) This means that whatever you're afraid of, or being encouraged to be afraid of, is in your mind. It is not in your living room, or just outside your door. You're thinking it. Which is good news. That's the one thing you have control over. At any moment, you can take a break from thinking scary thoughts, or, if you're like me and have a mind run amuck, you can choose to ignore them. Even better news, once you're free of self-imposed fear, you're much less likely to seek out an old, white guy to protect you. (Well, maybe there is.)"
"Jan 7th, 2016",In honor of the New Year I didn't write a vanity card.
"Jan 6th, 2016","I recently had a dream where I'm standing in a crowd of people. A soft voice in my head tells me that if I let go of opinions, judgments and criticism of all those around me, I will be set free. The voice makes clear that those things are like invisible tethers. They are binding chains that I myself create. I obey the voice and cease to judge, criticize or have an opinion on all the people around me. Immediately I'm infused with a deep sense of peace. On awakening, I realize I've been given a gift. A life-changing epiphany. Revitalized, I showered, dressed and drove to work. A few minutes from my home it became clear that the DWP had once again chosen the morning rush hour to shut down a lane and create gridlock. I immediately had an opinion, judgment and criticism. But this time I was able to exercise my newfound nocturnal wisdom, let them all go, and crawl along at eight miles an hour with a sense of ease and comfort. Then my phone rang and I was told CBS refused to discuss a future for Mike & Molly, effectively cancelling it. Once again, I found myself with an opinion, a judgment and a criticism. To further complicate matters, Bruce Springsteen was on my car radio singing about ""the ties that bi-yiyi- yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yind."" Regardless, I let them all go. And as promised in my dream, my heart was free. Broken, but free."
"Dec 17th, 2015","This past year I was inspired by the transgender movement which, to me, appears to be an effort to synchronize one's outward sexual identity with one's internal sexual experience. I couldn't help but notice that, in many cases, the people who do this appear to be extremely happy. Which got me thinking. I want to be extremely happy. Maybe it's time for me to make a change. But then I realized my discomfort is not with having a male human body. It's with having any human body. With that in mind, my next step was obvious. I started looking for a reputable surgeon who would help me become the first member of the trans-species movement. My hope was to become a porpoise, or a hawk. (I'm a big fan of hawks, with all the gliding and swooping.) After a long, exhausting search, I found a highly-regarded doctor in Pyongyang who was more than willing to do the operation if I could sneak him into Seoul. Which I did. But then, minutes before the procedure was to begin, I was told that once again my Writers Guild insurance wouldn't pay. Filled with frustration, I decided to lose my troublesome body altogether and become trans-human. With a few odds and ends purchased from Fry's, I created a device which uploaded my entire personality, including thoughts, memories and emotions, onto the internet. As the kids like to say, I achieved singularity. If you can spare a moment, please come visit me at: chucklorre.com/holidaycard"
"Dec 10th, 2015","I've long believed that my vanity cards should not just be used for light entertainment. Every once in awhile a card should be written that aspires to make life better for everyone who takes the time to read it. This is one of those cards. After years of struggle, I've finally figured out how to eat cookies in bed without getting crumbs all over the place. The trick is to break the cookies into small bite-sized pieces while still in the box or bag, then, and only then, pop the pieces into your mouth. Get it? There are no crumbs because the cookies are never bitten, they're only chewed. Of course, there is some downside risk. Whenever you bring an entire box or bag of cookies into bed, there is a strong likelihood that you will eat every cookie in the box or bag. This means that your bed, while crumb free, will be filled with regret. Not to worry. In a future vanity card I will explain how to handle regret. Like cookies, it involves breaking it into bite-sized pieces."

"Nov 19th, 2015","For the comedian, comic actor or comedy writer, nothing inflates the ego like the sound of people laughing. Nothing crushes it like their silence. This gives the audience enormous power. It's why performers and writers use the word ""kill"" to describe material that causes an explosion of laughter. ""That joke killed"" is a way of saying that, for a brief moment, they were able to dominate and control people who otherwise might hurt their feelings. For a brief moment they are victors, not victims. It also explains why many critics, network executives and ""cool"" people remain stoic in the face of good comedy. Laughing out loud makes one appear vulnerable. Killable. These people are also defending fragile egos. Which raises the question, what happens to comedy when the human ego is removed? When laughter, or its absence, neither builds nor destroys this phantasm self?<br/><br/>Sadly, I wouldn't know.<br/><br/>""The only cure for vanity is laughter, and the only fault that is laughable is vanity.""<br/><br/> Henri Bergson"
"Nov 12th, 2015","Sometimes I feel like I'm standing on a dock watching Western culture drift away from me like a massive boat. As I imagine it, the people on the deck are not waving goodbye. They're looking away, toward the horizon. The future. And the boat is accelerating. I don't bring this up to generate sympathy. No one threw me overboard. Disembarking was a conscious choice. And so is returning. With a little effort I can take a skiff out to sea and scramble up that gangplank anytime I want. I just have to stop being afraid of Facebook. And Instagram. And Twitter. And LinkedIn. And Tumblr. And Pinterest. And Snapchat. And, well... I guess the Internet. Also, I might need to jettison my love for belabored maritime metaphors."
"Nov 5th, 2015","I grew up devouring science fiction books. I was like a little Pac-Man, gobbling up everything I could get my hands on: short stories, novels, and, of course, comic books. Looking back, I realize that sci-fi and, to some degree, fantasy novels, were my first attempt at escaping reality (later attempts would prove to be a bit more problematic). Regardless, I now see that immersing myself in this kind of literature informs my current view of the world. The path of history is, for me, forever seen through the eyes and imagination of Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Ray Bradbury, Roger Zelazny, Frank Herbert, Larry Niven, Philip K. Dick, H.G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, and many, many more. Which is why I consider all efforts to control human behavior through force as ultimately doomed to fail. Sure, they might work for a while. That's where the cool story is - the resistance and overcoming of authoritarian rule. But at the end of the day, the macro, sci-fi view is always toward greater freedom, regardless of what form it takes. The real evil, the much more insidious method of control, is actually what we do to ourselves.

"Oct 26th, 2015","Sometimes I have conversations with people who are not there. Not out loud conversations. No Thorazine yet, thank you very much. But I definitely catch myself having spirited debates and heated arguments with folks who exist only in my head. Which doesn't stop them from speaking forcefully, and, at times, eloquently on their own behalf. On occasion they are people I know. Other times they are purely fictional creations, brought into existence to question my thinking, my actions, or just piss me off. (Because there's not enough real people pissing me off, I've gotta make some up.) Anyway, the reason I thought this was worth discussing is that I'm fascinated by what I like to call ""the bifurcated self."" Consciousness that has split itself in two in order to create its own suffering. (Because there's not enough real suffering going on, we need to make more.) But I've recently become more fascinated by the idea that there is no self at all. That the solution to bifurcation is not reuniting warring selves, it's dropping the entire concept of self. The memories, emotions, thoughts and attitudes that combine to create the self are finally recognized as nothing more than ripples on the surface of a pond. And the truth of what we are, collectively and individually, is the pond itself. That which silently embraces the endless dance of form. Deep. Clear. Still. Reflecting the infinite and eternal, while receiving with equanimity both the beauty and the ugliness that falls into it - even the critical inner voice which is talking to me right now. Excuse me while I respond.<br/><br/>""Shut up, I am too a pond!"""
"Oct 19th, 2015","It seems to me that the biggest, most momentous choice of our lives is the one that none of us gets to make. I'm talking about the decision to be here, to be alive. Now before we digress into the choice of leaving this life, a subject best suited for handwritten notes left on the bed stand, let's investigate the initial premise. Simply put, we all arrive here screaming, crying and covered in goo, without prior consultation. Or so it appears. If in fact we were part of the decision to become cognizant, the memory of that process has been completely wiped from our consciousness. But what if it were retrievable? What if we could become aware of the primary decision to live, the fateful choice to participate in the world of time, energy and form? Wouldn't that improve our daily condition? No matter how difficult and confusing life was, we would always be clear on one thing, ""I asked to be here. This is my choice."" Of course, there's another option to consider. We are here against our will. The unending cycle of birth, life and death is a sentence. We are souls in prison. But that grim, Matrix-like scenario falls apart the minute you ask how hell on earth could possibly include gelato."
"Oct 12th, 2015","The human mind is very adept at labeling. Left to its own devices, it will label situations, things, places, and people. It's a pretty handy app. Except when it comes to people. Over time those labels tend to solidify. They become all we can see. They become what we experience. The true depth of a person, the breathtaking miracle of their very existence, is replaced with a word. A sound. An assemblage of vowels and consonants. Ink or digital letters on paper or screen. Which is why I sometimes try to look at people and see them, witness them if you will, without immediately attaching a mental label. This is especially fun to do in a crowded public place. After a few minutes of practicing nonjudgemental looking, I find my heart filling with affection for total strangers. It's an extraordinary experience. I encourage you to try it sometime. Be warned though, when you feel affection, you can't stop smiling. This may cause total strangers to react fearfully, or, in New York City, say, ""What the hell are you lookin' at, ya friggin' freak?!"" ""Friggin' freak"" being your new label."

"Sep 28th, 2015","I've come to realize that my vanity cards are the perfect vehicle to explore the vainest thing imaginable, the ego. The illusory self. The mind-made, compulsively thinking entity that usurped the mantle of ""I"" from the eternal and infinite consciousness from which it sprang. The never-satisfied ghost in the machine that believes itself to be separate from the rest of creation and exists in a constant state of dread because it knows it is temporal, a phantasm. In other words, ""I think therefore I am"" is false. ""I am that I am"" is true. Now I just have to figure out how to turn this into a sitcom. My working title is either ""Hey, Eckhart!"" or ""For Whom the Tolle Tolls."""
"Sep 21st, 2015",The Writers' Table<br/><br/><br/><br/>Where the magic happens.
"May 11th, 2015","When I sat down to write this, my five hundredth vanity card, my first inclination was to use self-deprecating humor. Something along the lines of how proud I am to have a large body of work. Sure, it has no real value, but hey, it's still large. If a person were to sit down and try to read all my cards, the verb ""wade"" might come to mind. But then I thought, ""No. I am not going to waste this momentous event with false modesty. I am going to trumpet my accomplishment. I am going to take a well- deserved bow for eighteen years of hard work. Unpaid work. Work done just for the love of doing it. And let's not forget, I've really spilled my guts in some of these things. A man's life and innermost thoughts exposed for all to see. And oh, how I've labored over the jokes. Literally thousands of hours, grinding away, trying to find just the right combination of words to make you laugh. What was I thinking with the self- deprecation? Five hundred vanity cards. Who else has done that? I'll tell you who. Nobody. Just me. Yeah, that's right. You heard me. And I'll tell you another thing. No one ever will do it. You know why? Because you have to produce five hundred friggin' TV shows first!""<br/><br/>Okay, I'm done trumpeting.<br/><br/>And I think I need help."
"May 4th, 2015","I've been around sitcoms for almost thirty years. During that time I've heard a lot of laughter from studio audiences, writers, actors, directors, studio executives, cameramen and myself. But not all laughter is created equal. There are the lonely guffaws of nervous writers and directors anxious to fill the silence that trails behind some jokes like toilet paper on a shoe. And then there's the grimacing, head-bob throat chuckle of network executives. For years I took this strangled, tepid response personally. Now I know it for what it is - the sound of fear. Sometimes studio audiences will try and help a show with what we in the business call ""a mercy laugh."" There's no mistaking this one. It's the sound of two hundred people who just want to go home. And finally, there's the true, out loud, involuntary explosion of laughter. It's a beautiful, contagious sound. For comedy writers, it makes you feel like your life has value. That all your neurotic suffering is worthwhile. Actors have told me it makes them feel like they're surfing a wave of pure happiness... and that they can keep their kids in private school. Network executives tell me they're not sure how they feel until the results from the focus group comes in. Regardless, in a troubled world, real laughter, that spontaneous outburst of humanness, has to be taken as seriously as a wet fart in white pants."

"Apr 20th, 2015","To be read aloud at my funeral.<br/><br/>Well... this is depressing. Which, I guess, beats the alternative. Certainly don't want my send off to be a ding-dong-the-witch-is- dead flash mob. Perhaps there's a middle ground. A little light sobbing, some clothes rending. Nothing over the top. To all the actors here, let's try and keep this day about me. Okay, now that we've settled on the appropriate level of somber, I'd like to go over a few things before LIFE GOES ON WITHOUT ME, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! First, I want it known that I am deeply grateful for how things turned out. In retrospect - and yes, everything is in retrospect now - even the awful stuff seems to have had a purpose. When I was a young man a pretty girl smiled at me, so I did exactly what any young man would do, I joined her new-age religion. Seven years later I awoke, as if from a dream, and carried on like nothing happened. Which made sense because for seven years nothing happened. Being too poor to go to a doctor when I had ulcerative colitis made me a big supporter of free health care, as well as appreciative of the life-affirming qualities in a good bowel movement. Two failed marriages and many failed relationships taught me the fine art of apologizing. A decade or so of professional failures proved that hardship builds character, just not a very good one. And then there's all the great things that happened. My children - despite years of fatherly neglect - turned out to be awesome. Shaking off a severe drop in revenue, the Jack Daniels company managed to limp along without me. I stumbled into an incredible career when I realized I had a better chance at becoming the next Sherwood Schwartz than the next Bruce Springsteen. So again, looking back, other than dying, I have no real complaints. Looking forward, well, if the lights in the chapel flicker... NOW!... it means I'm a non-corporeal spiritual entity with a delightful streak of mischievousness (more Spooky than Casper). If not, the likely scenario is I exist only in your memories, and, after the ceremony, as landfill in a Jewish cemetery. So, to sum up a lifetime: ""Here lies me. I did the best I could with what I had. I never stopped trying to be better. My flaws were plentiful. No need to list them here. We all know what they were -- don't we ladies? But I did love. And as I got older I think I learned how to love more. I hope that's what you remember about me.""<br/><br/>""And that I was perfectly willing to end a heartfelt moment with a cheap dick joke."""
"Apr 13th, 2015","Hardly  a  day  goes  by  when  I  don't  think  about  quitting  this  business.  Hanging it up.  Taking my proverbial bat and ball and  going  home.   In  my  imagination,  the  day  after  I  quit  is  a  wonderful,  relaxing,  joyful  experience.   I  reconnect  with  old  friends, walk on the beach, read, listen to music, play guitar,  play  golf,  eat  leisurely  meals  off  of  real  plates,  exercise,  meditate, maybe go see a matinee, or take a stab at writing a few  pages  of  a  self-indulgent,  joke-free  play  filled  with  people  screaming  at  each  other,  and  then,  after  taking  the  dog  for  a  walk, climb into bed and fall into a peaceful, stress-free sleep.   The day after that, bored out of my mind, I start drinking around  the clock and quickly descend into a dark, frothing madness that  leads to either being institutionalized or liver failure and an  agonizing,  premature  death.   The  really  scary  part?   There's  hardly  a  day  goes  by  when  I  don't  think  about  quitting  this  business."
"Apr 2nd, 2015","I tried meditating on the beach today. After a few minutes of gazing out at the ocean these words floated up into my consciousness, ""An impersonal, life-creating vastness that is ever-changing."" The metaphor touched me deeply. It seemed as if time stopped, or at least was on hold. A feeling of peace came upon me, or more accurately, from within me. Then a new thought wafted, ""I am alive in an impersonal universe and I can't help but take it personally."" Then another thought, ""Life is sustained by eating other life. What's up with that?"" Then one more, ""Ever-changing is just a pompous way of saying $#!% happens."" Realizing I'd strayed from my meditation, I took a deep cleansing breath and once again looked out at the ocean. That simple joy and serenity I'd felt earlier returned immediately, followed by a new thought, or rather, sensation, ""I urgently have to urinate."" I looked around and saw no facilities. Not even a tree to hide behind. Desperate for relief, I looked back to the ocean and heard these words calmly whispered in my mind, ""Impersonal also means I will never judge you.""<br/><br/>The water was cold, but I managed."
"Mar 30th, 2015","To my understanding, comedy is a form of entertainment primarily meant to evoke laughter. There are, of course, many other means by which entertainment can be achieved. Off the top of my head, there's suspense, excitement, horror, heartbreak, shock, mild amusement, informative, and physical arousal, aka porn. Sometimes these forms can be combined to create a hybrid type of entertainment. For example, one could conceivably concoct a story that makes the audience laugh, cry, scream, and pause the DVR in order to replay that last bit over and over until they need a Kleenex. My point is, while there are many ways to tell a story, and many purposes to telling them, let's not lose sight of what the categorizing words actually mean. Or, to paraphrase something Sigmund Freud may or may not have said, ""Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, unless it's in your pants pocket, at which point you can safely call it a schlong."""
"Mar 16th, 2015","Random Advice to Young Comedy Writers Don't eat a heavy lunch. It's bad luck to sit in a director's chair with your name on it. Good ideas feel good. They're almost gentle. Be suspicious of ideas you're really, really, really excited about - it might be a bipolar thing. Never stand up when pitching an idea, you're probably excited. There's no getting around it, some pants are luckier than others. Comedy written at three AM isn't as funny as you think it is. Comedy written at three PM when you're drunk isn't as funny as you think it is. Comedy written at three PM, stone cold sober, rested and well-fed might be funny. Might not. You want certainty in your profession, try accounting. If a show fails it doesn't mean you're a bad person. It just feels that way. Sleep with a retainer in your mouth to avoid grinding your teeth to dust. When the audience doesn't laugh, your soul is not being dragged out your ass. It just feels that way. With that in mind, don't be fooled by laughter that is simply an act of mercy. Mom may love you, but she is not a good barometer of your talent. With that in mind, if your mother truly loves you, you're probably not a comedy writer. Never watch someone read your script. Use this time to go to the bathroom and pass blood. Try and put the funny word at the end of the sentence. But sometimes don't. Again, Uncertainty is thy God. People who write poisonous things about your work are using up precious moments of their life dwelling on yours. These are moments they will never get back. Let that be a comfort to you. And finally, every time, without fail, your anger is really just your fear in disguise. The only reason you get angry is because you cannot tolerate fear. It's also why you have unlucky chairs and lucky pants."
"Mar 9th, 2015","Many, many, many, many years ago, I had a job as a greens keeper at a little par 3, nine hole golf course. Every morning I'd get up at dawn and drive the tractor-mower up and down the fairways. Then I'd roll the special lawnmower over the greens, trying my best to make them both beautiful and challenging. In my mind, I imagined I was grooming Augusta National. Thinking back I can't help but remember that time as being perfect. My heart was at peace, my work was fulfilling, and each day was a gentle echo of the one before. But I quit that job and moved to Los Angeles because I wanted more. Can you imagine that? I wanted more than a par 27 Walden Pond. Don't get me wrong, I am deeply grateful for the way things turned out. It's just, try as I might, I can't make a sitcom smell like fresh cut grass in the morning."
"Mar 5th, 2015",The impact you had on our show and on our lives is everlasting.
"Mar 2nd, 2015","I recently found myself reminiscing about an incident that occurred almost thirty years ago. I had just landed my first job as a prime-time sitcom writer and was sitting in a room 'punching up' a script with a few other young writers and a couple of old pros, when one of the gray-haired, comedy mavens grumbled that the mediocre joke we were trying to improve was ""good enough"" and that we should ""move on."" He rationalized this by saying, ""No one will know the difference"" and, ""It's just a sitcom."" I remember being offended. I quietly promised myself that if I ever got a chance to write and produce my own series I would never think that way. I would never become so jaded and cynical that I squandered the opportunity to entertain people by assuming they ""won't know the difference,"" and by sneeringly regarding what I do for a living as being ""just a sitcom."" And I never have. But I have wondered what exactly is this thing I do. And I think I've finally figured it out. A sitcom is an extended conversation between writers, actors, directors and the audience. In success, the conversation goes on for years. Pre-internet, the viewers responded simply by watching or not watching. Now their opinions are loud, immediate and fully articulated. And it's great. And it's scary. But it's a real conversation between real people with real feelings. So we all need to choose our words carefully."

"Feb 16th, 2015","I start most of my vanity cards without knowing how to end them. I purposely write myself into a corner and then try to wriggle out of it. Which, I now realize, is the story of my life. Over and over, I have consciously entrapped myself in difficult situations and relationships and then struggled to get free. Which leads me to wonder, is this cycle the very essence of existence? Are we destined to live out an endless, self- imposed drama entitled ""stuck, free, stuck, free""? Or, with a bit more flourish, ""woe is me, hallelujah, woe is me, hallelujah""? And if this is the case, is life and death just one more variation on the theme? And is it the last? Does the pendulum swinging between entrapment and freedom continue beyond the grave? (Perhaps on a quantum level?) Which poses a new question. If we exist in an eternal loop of suffering and escape, why bother escaping? Why not just embrace the prison we're in? The answer, of course, is that surrender is its own form of freedom. Which is why I've given up on writing my way out of this vanity card. I intend to remain here, happily trapped in a weak premise."

"Jan 12th, 2015","The things I have spent my life depending on are undependable. Because they are things. And things are, by their very nature, subject to change. This applies to people as well. People change. People leave. Inevitably we all leave. The world, therefore, is essentially an unstable, uncertain environment. That's why I choose to believe in, and depend on, an unchanging, eternal, omnipresent non-thing. I prefer not to call it God, because the very word tends to thing things up. So I try not to call it. I try to experience it. Easy to do looking out at the ocean. Hard to do looking up at the ocean. Easy to do when you look at a baby. Hard to do if the baby is next to you on a long plane flight. Easy to do when you look at a pretty girl. Hard to do if you were once married to her. Clearly what blocks me from transcendence is judgment. If I were able to suspend having an opinion on drowning, other peoples' baby's vomit, and alimony, if I could simply see these things as they are - actions devoid of meaning until I give them meaning - I could experience some semblance of union with the infinite sublime. I'd instantaneously transition from neurotic sitcom writer to one seriously badass guru dude. People would travel great distances to ask me for guidance with their personal problems. I'd wisely tell them ""It is what it is."" They'd judge this as being ridiculously inadequate advice and punch me. But I'd be okay with it because I'm, you know, exalted."

Barely awake, I stumbled into the bathroom, lifted the seat, then, for reasons we can only call stupid, decided I was too sleepy to stand. So I sat down and fell into the toilet. Shocked by the ass splashdown, I leaped up, slammed my head against the door, stumbled backwards, ripped the phone off the wall - yes, I have a phone in there - then stuck the landing with one foot in the magazine basket and the other in the toilet.

"Nov 20th, 2014","I believe in reincarnation. Not in the traditional sense. My  feeling is that I have lived many different lives within this  lifetime. I've also observed that each new incarnation came  about after a period of intense physical and/or emotional pain.  In other words, just like childbirth, it hurts to be born. Or  reborn. A lot of crying happens. Death, illness, poverty,  divorce, giving up a dream, waking up from a dream, getting  fired, divorce again, substance abuse, being publicly ridiculed  by a former friend - all these things have led to rebirth. To  new lives.<br/><br/>The Buddha taught that change and impermanence is a fundamental  fact of existence. He further pointed out that this fact made  suffering inevitable. He didn't mention that sometimes, after  the pain is gone, you open your eyes to a life beyond your  wildest dreams. That's what happened to me. But I know that  this too shall pass.

"Oct 13th, 2014","In my last vanity card I announced that I was quitting writing vanity cards. I was pretty firm about it. Didn't leave myself a lot of wiggle room. Not that I need any. Nothing's changed. I still feel like I made the right choice. Sure, I might have welcomed a groundswell of support for me to rethink my decision. I mean, I have been writing these things for 18 years. You'd think it would mean more to people. But no. The general reaction to my announcement was mild disappointment followed by a shrug. A literal shrug. I actually saw several pairs of shoulders lift earward an inch or two. No one sat me down and pleaded with me to reconsider. Nor was there a celebration on my having achieved such a singularly unnecessary, non-literary achievement. If anyone felt the urge to reminisce about a personal favorite vanity card out of the FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY-THREE that I've labored over, they certainly didn't bring it up with me. No, the best I could hope for was shoulder spasms. One ""friend"" politely asked me what I'm going to do with all the free time I'll have now. I said that I planned on cultivating bitterness. He looked to see if I was kidding. I shrugged. Which, if you haven't noticed, is how one elegantly ties up disparate threads in a meandering essay that is clearly destined to be underappreciated."
"Oct 6th, 2014","We need to have a serious conversation about these vanity cards.   Before we start I just want to make clear that you've been great.  For something like eighteen years you've paused your VCRs and DVRs to read them.  Maybe you chuckled.  Maybe you shrugged.  Maybe one of them made a deep, positive impact on your life.  Or, more likely, made you want to mail me a letter dusted with anthrax.  Doesn't matter.  The important thing to remember is that this is not about you.  It's me.  Gimme a minute.  This is hard.  Okay, here it is... It's time for me to stop writing these things.  Now before you say anything, just hear me out.  The brash young man who liked to jerk a bony knee into the corporate ball sack is no longer brash nor young.  The smart aleck who once delighted in twisting the cultural nipple is not feeling so smart anymore, nor is he clear on what an aleck is.  And perhaps most telling, the smug word jockey who never missed an opportunity to tickle the establishment prostate sans Astroglide, now finds that metaphor offensive.  Which means it's time to hang it up.  It's time to write the last vanity card.  Which is what this is.  So... Thank you.  It's been a great ride.  I'll miss our time together.  Remember me fondly.  All things that never should have happened in the first place must come to an end.  Don't cry for me Argentina.  Or West Covina.  I miss Andy Rooney.  Can anybody explain CBS's scheduling decisions to me?  We are moving into an age where our memory is outsourced.  The unknowable can be experienced even though it cannot be articulated.  God is everything or God is nothing.  Wait, maybe it can be articulated.  I've taken to wearing frivolous socks.  How come there are only porn stars?  Where are the porn supporting players?  When the noise is constant there is no information.  If you're ever at an awards ceremony and they flash a happy picture of you on a screen while a woman sits nearby playing a lonely cello, it means you're a ghost watching your In Memoriam.  I changed my name in an effort to eradicate what I mistakenly thought was my self.  Marriage: one year of flames, thirty years of ashes.  I stole that last one from somebody.  I don't remember who.  Turns out the Supreme Court was right.  Corporations are people.  Selfish, unscrupulous people.  I've been struggling with memory loss and a mysterious, persistent cough.  Sometimes in the middle of the night I find myself wondering if I traveled to central Africa and forgot."
"Sep 29th, 2014","When I was a kid I loved to watch The Honeymooners, starring Jackie Gleason and Art Carney. Some of my favorite childhood memories are sitting with my father and laughing hysterically at these two comic geniuses. There is a scene in tonight's episode of Big Bang where Wolowitz prepares to throw a baseball while his wife watches with growing frustration. It's an outright steal from classic scenes performed by Gleason and Carney (who probably stole it from Laurel and Hardy, who probably stole it from Euripides). Regardless, I prefer to call it an homage. Something my dad would've appreciated."

"May 12th, 2014","Drugs and alcohol are the most commonly used substances to mask one's feelings.<br/><br/>Less toxic means to perform this same function are shopping, sex, exercise, eating, traveling, watching films and television, reading, sleeping and, my all-time favorite, work.<br/><br/>I've been on hiatus for less than two weeks.<br/><br/>During that time I've flown across the country twice, gained six pounds, read three books, played very bad golf on very good golf courses, caught up on The Walking Dead, Vikings, Mad Men, The Good Wife, Justified, Game of Thrones, Fargo, binge-viewed The Wire (again), turned napping into an art form, and maxed out a credit card.<br/><br/>There's only one emotional avoidance mechanism left to explore.<br/><br/>Which makes me wonder if V.

"May 1st, 2014","The government of China has decided that ""The Big Bang Theory"" is not appropriate for viewing. I have to assume there was some sort of formal process involved in this decision. In all likelihood, a gaggle of communists sat in a darkened room and watched a few episodes. I like to think they took notes that were later used to formulate an official document that detailed the corrosive cultural effects caused by the shenanigans of Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Amy and Bernadette. I like to think that during these screenings one of them laughed out loud and was promptly sent to a re-education camp on the outskirts of Urumqi. I like to think one of them was reassured by how often the characters on the show eat Chinese takeout. I like to think there's a Chinese word for shenanigans. Regardless, the whole affair makes me very happy. The overlords of 1.3 billion people are afraid of our sitcom. Exactly what we were going for!"
"Apr 28th, 2014","I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize to all the people who were offended by this years' vanity cards. Please know that was never my goal. As always, each essay (blurb?) was written in the hopes that it might initiate a little conversation and laughter.* But, best laid plans, right? If by reading any of them you have concluded that I'm a horrible person, I hope you'll give me another chance. I think that if you got to know me, your loathing would melt away and, in time, blossom into indifference.<br/><br/>* In my imagination, the conversation and laughter would be something like:<br/><br/>""Heh, heh, that Lorre guy's kinda clever!""<br/><br/>""Yes - heh, heh - he just makes the words sing.""<br/><br/>""Sing? Please. This is not literature. I mean, it's somewhat amusing, but let's face it, he clearly has a penchant for fancy words, sophomoric irony and cheap, vulgar jokes at the end of each card.""<br/><br/>""I suppose you're right.

"Apr 21st, 2014","I have long believed that if there is a purpose to our existence, it is to bear witness to the mystery and beauty of creation. My thinking, as always, was simple -- a universe unobserved is just a wasted effort. What's a play without an audience? Going forward from that understanding, I further believe that the key ingredient for conscious living is curiosity. What will happen next? Why is this happening now? How does that work? Where did it come from? Where is it going? To be curious is to be in the moment. To be in the moment is to be in a state of grace. And yet, the older I become, the more I'm inclined to look away from what is and seek refuge in my staid ideas of what should be. As a result, my daily challenge is to resist the siren song of nostalgia. I was created to stand in awe and wonderment amidst the spectacle of eternity. And, apparently, to write sitcoms."
"Apr 14th, 2014",Thank you for watching Mom.

Half the time they're innocuous, the other half they just piss people off. To what end? What's it all about, Alfie? Anyway, sorry to vent. I know this isn't what you wanted to see when you paused your DVR. I wouldn't blame you if you threw your hands up in disgust and went off to read someone else's vanity card. Oh wait, you can't. I'm the only knucklehead who does this. Okay, I feel better. Not better enough to write something worth reading, but certainly good enough to let this one just fizzle out."
"Apr 3rd, 2014","I believe that the much argued ""sanctity of marriage"" ended in 1960 <br/><br/>when the FDA approved the birth control pill for contraception.  In <br/><br/>other words, the minute science allowed women to take charge of <br/><br/>their reproductive cycle, the cultural reason for protecting <br/><br/>marriage - ensuring the continuation of the species - collapsed. <br/><br/>Additionally, when conception became a fundamental female choice, <br/><br/>as opposed to a random event, thousands of years of patriarchal <br/><br/>rule came to an end.  That is why male-dominated religions and <br/><br/>social institutions are so filled with rage right now. They know, <br/><br/>at least subconsciously, that the jig is up. Their tribal blood- drenched reign is over.  We are witnessing the death throes of the <br/><br/>testosterone epoch. Unfortunately, organizations and philosophies <br/><br/>that took thousands of years to develop might take just as long to <br/><br/>die.

"Mar 17th, 2014","I've been known to throw my hat in the ring when different high <br/><br/>profile jobs become available (I'm easily bored and also the proud <br/><br/>owner of a hat). A few weeks ago I dipped a toe into the race for <br/><br/>Sheriff of Los Angeles, as well as an open seat in the U.S. <br/><br/>Congress. Unfortunately, there was no groundswell of support for <br/><br/>either position so I gracefully moved on. But now a real golden <br/><br/>opportunity has emerged: President of ABC-Disney TV. Now that's a <br/><br/>gig I could kick ass on. Mr. Iger, you and I have known each <br/><br/>other a long time. Going back to those halcyon days on ""Roseanne"" <br/><br/>when we'd drive to work singing the theme song from the film <br/><br/>version of ""MASH."" (Bob knows what I mean. Everyone else can <br/><br/>look it up - then look up ""halcyon."") You know I'll give it my <br/><br/>all. I already have a great idea for an ABC series. A real <br/><br/>ground-breaking dramedy. It's called ""Chastity Jones"" and tells <br/><br/>the story of a beautiful woman who, after being burned in <br/><br/>relationship after relationship, decides never to have sex again. <br/><br/>And I mean never. Which of course makes her wildly attractive to <br/><br/>men who pursue her doggedly. And I mean doggedly. Regardless, <br/><br/>she stays true to her vow. As the series progresses, every aspect <br/><br/>of her life improves while all her friends who are out there, <br/><br/>ankles up, banging away, suffer endless heartache. Honestly, I <br/><br/>think it's the kind of show that could start a trend. Heck, with <br/><br/>a little luck a deadly new STD will arrive from Africa and we'll <br/><br/>be ahead of the curve! Alternative title: ""The Last Orgasm."" But <br/><br/>we have to move quick here. I'm also trying for El Chapo's old job <br/><br/>as el presidente of the Sinaloa Cartel. I've pitched them some <br/><br/>great ideas about tunnels, mules and product placement. How much <br/><br/>would sales go up if we could convince a few actors and musicians <br/><br/>to endorse drugs? Huh? Huh? Outside the box, baby!"

"Feb 6th, 2014","I'm thinking of running for Sheriff of Los Angeles County. I have no qualifications but perhaps I could use that as an asset. (In a debate I could say that as far as law enforcement is concerned, I have an unblemished record.) And I could add levity to the proceedings. Maybe run on a platform that emphasizes the need for heavily armed robot cops. My campaign slogan would be, ""Robots With Guns! What Could Go Wrong?"" I'm also mulling the congressional seat recently opened by the retirement of Henry Waxman. Again, I think my complete lack of experience is a selling point. I'm also a big fan of incompetent government, as the overly organized ones tend to put people like me on trains to Poland. For this elective office I'm thinking I need a campaign slogan that alienates no one. Something along the lines of, ""Send me to Congress and watch what happens!"""

"Jan 30th, 2014","Not that it really matters, but the joke I made at the Producers<br/><br/>Guild Awards regarding Ben Affleck's genitals being of sufficient <br/><br/>size to fill the caped crusader's codpiece was just that, a joke. <br/><br/>I've never met Mr. Affleck in or out of a men's room. Nor am I in <br/><br/>the habit of peeking at another guy's junk while standing at a <br/><br/>urinal. (I mostly stare at the tiles and worry that the invisible <br/><br/>auto-flush light beam is secretly cooking my internal organs.) I <br/><br/>just wanted to open my speech with a cheap laugh about the Golden <br/><br/>Globes. To be completely honest, the original version of the joke <br/><br/>had me peeing next to and peeking at Martin Scorsese -- who was, <br/><br/>at best, a grower not a show-er. I cut it, wisely I thought, <br/><br/>because it felt unfair to ""belittle"" a giant of cinema, even if I <br/><br/>had issues with ""Hugo."" I then considered telling the same joke <br/><br/>with Harvey Weinstein as the celebrity at the neighboring stall, <br/><br/>but cut that as well because I worried that he might be able to <br/><br/>have me hurt. It was only when I thought of Mr. Affleck that it <br/><br/>finally hit me. If I'm going to make up stuff about another man's <br/><br/>penis, why not go positive? Embellish his endowment if you will. <br/><br/>It's still funny. And it also allowed me to work in the Comic-Con <br/><br/>Batman angle. Win-win right? Wrong. While the joke did score at <br/><br/>the PGA event, it got way too much traction afterward. Which is <br/><br/>why I now feel the need to set the record straight. You want to <br/><br/>know if Affleck is man enough to be Bruce Wayne? Ask his wife. <br/><br/>Or, if you're feeling man enough, rent ""Daredevil."" On Blu-ray."
"Jan 20th, 2014","I had a recurring dream as a child that left an indelible mark on <br/><br/>me. Unlike my other dreams, this one had no recognizable images, <br/><br/>no mommies or daddies, no friends, relatives, teachers, scary <br/><br/>monsters or scrappy Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek.  This dream was <br/><br/>simply a field of darkness and light fighting to dominate my <br/><br/>mental screen. That was it.  For what seemed like long periods of <br/><br/>time, I would bear silent witness to a cosmic struggle between <br/><br/>malicious, inky blackness and radiant, life-affirming light.  I <br/><br/>would, of course, be pulling for the light to win.  But it never <br/><br/>did.  No matter how much I willed it, light could never maintain <br/><br/>the field of view.  Darkness would always come crawling back, <br/><br/>invading the space and ultimately taking over.  It was both <br/><br/>exhausting and upsetting.  Thankfully, at some point during early <br/><br/>adolescence, the dream stopped, never to return.  Looking back, I <br/><br/>see it as no more than an immature mind's attempt to reconcile <br/><br/>good and evil.  I understand now that the world is not nearly that <br/><br/>simple.  Those two opposing forces do not actually exist. They <br/><br/>are evaluations. Opinions.  And yet, my mind continually tries to <br/><br/>manifest them as being real.  I catch myself doing it whenever I <br/><br/>toggle back and forth between MSNBC and Fox News playing out their <br/><br/>cable TV version of my childhood dream.  The only difference is <br/><br/>that I'm an adult now. I understand that Roger Ailes thinks he's <br/><br/>on the side of the light."

"Jan 2nd, 2014","Confession.  Outside of a small cadre of friends, family and coworkers, I have become hopelessly incapable of remembering people's names.  I don't know if it's due to stress, exhaustion, age or an extra-terrestrial parasite devouring my frontal lobe, but I am fighting a losing battle to retain names.  I've tried and failed to overcome this using mnemonic devices.  (Most memorably when I played golf with a man named Cooney.  In order to remember his unusual name I mentally associated it with George Clooney.  As we teed off, I repeated quietly in my head, ""Clooney, Cooney.  Clooney, Cooney.""  I was feeling pretty good about my efforts until the sixth hole when Cooney asked me why I kept calling him George.)  Another aspect of my retention dysfunction comes when I'm being introduced to someone.  I literally black out while the person's name is announced.  (My solution for this is to feign hearing loss, which seems less embarrassing than admitting to temporary unconsciousness.)  To make matters worse, I'm constantly worrying that people who greet me by name will think I'm being rude or dismissive when my best response is a feeble, ""Hey, man"", or the ever meaningless, ""Hey, how ya' doin'?""  It's gotten to the point where I'm truly frightened by my befuddlement.  Which is why I'd like to propose a simple solution.  When you see me, point to your head and say your name over and over again.  If, when next we meet, I greet you with, ""Hey, good to see ya!"", repeat the process.  Or consider wearing a name tag."
"Jan 2nd, 2014","This vanity card is dedicated to a very pretty and very talented<br/><br/>young actress named Lexie Contursi. Let me explain. In<br/><br/>tonight's episode of ""The Big Bang Theory,"" Penny struggles <br/><br/>emotionally when her small guest role on ""NCIS"" is cut. In an <br/><br/>unrelated story, which oddly became very related, Koothrappali <br/><br/>and Stuart go to a shopping mall with a plan to talk to <br/><br/>unattractive strangers in order to build up their confidence <br/><br/>with attractive girls. Almost immediately they are approached <br/><br/>by a beautiful young woman, played by Lexie, who asks them for <br/><br/>directions to a coffee shop. Sadly, or hopefully, comically, <br/><br/>they run from her because they've yet to do the grunt work of <br/><br/>talking to regular-looking folks. And here's where the two <br/><br/>stories intersect. We had to cut it in order to get the episode <br/><br/>down to the required running time. Penny gets cut. Lexie gets <br/><br/>cut. One is make believe. One is real. Which is why I wanted <br/><br/>to take this opportunity to tell Lexie, and all her friends <br/><br/>and relatives, that she nailed the part. Just nailed it. The <br/><br/>fact that it did not appear in tonight's episode had absolutely <br/><br/>nothing to do with her performance. So, on behalf of everyone <br/><br/>at ""The Big Bang Theory,"" I'd like to extend a heartfelt apology <br/><br/>to Lexie Contursi, and assure her that we will try to find a <br/><br/>way to get her back on the show. Of course an even better <br/><br/>resolution would be if she became a big movie star and got to <br/><br/>tell David Letterman the funny story of the time she had one <br/><br/>stupid line in a sitcom and it got cut. It happens, Lexie. Ask <br/><br/>Sharon Stone about the time she didn't get the part of Paul <br/><br/>Reiser's girlfriend on ""My Two Dads."""

While there is no guarantee that the <br/><br/>transgressor will be relieved of shame and guilt, the forgiver <br/><br/>will always feel better. In other words, forgiveness is, first <br/><br/>and foremost, self-serving.

I'm thinking of writing a children's story about a leaf on a tree who arrogantly insists he's a self-made, independent leaf. Then one day a fierce wind blows him off his branch and to the ground below. As his life slowly ebbs away, he looks up at the magnificent old tree that had been his home and realizes that he had never been on his own. His entire life he had been part of something bigger and more beautiful than anything he could have imagined. In a blinding flash, he awakens from the delusion of self. Then an arrogant, self-centered kid rakes him up and bags him. I'm wondering if maybe I should stop writing these freakin' vanity cards."

"Nov 7th, 2013","Dear Guys Working on the 405 Freeway, How's it going? I only ask because you started work over five years ago to add more lanes and, well... there aren't any. I've also noticed that on most days you're not actually doing anything. Is it possible you've grown bored with the project? I certainly would understand that. I've got more than a few half- finished scripts sitting in my desk. Of course, when I blow off my job millions of commuters aren't, how shall we say... fornicated. (Hey, maybe we should call it the 4-nication-05 freeway!) Regardless, I just want you to know that I'm rooting for you to complete your Herculean task and cut the ribbon on what will undoubtedly be a meaningless effort to ease traffic. I'd also like to offer up a few suggestions. From my untrained eye, you appear to be understaffed. Perhaps you might consider hiring a few thousand more guys and work in 'round the clock shifts, instead of, you know, just when you feel like it. Also, to avoid angry commuters flipping you off, how about giving them a heads up when you close an off ramp for no apparent reason? (Maybe a few miles in advance instead of a hundred yards.) And finally, I need to ask a small favor. Several times a week I crawl along the ol' 4-nication-05 with a bladder that is near to bursting. How about we work out a system where I, and other urinary-challenged drivers, get to pull over and share your port-a-potties? Maybe we can repay your hospitality by bringing you fresh magazines to read while you're in there working. Sincerely,  Chuck Lorre"

He also gained worldwide recognition for his tireless efforts as a glib substitute for the words “I’m amused.” His other interests included frowning and winking. He is survived by his children, Sideways Surprised Face, Sideways Glasses Face, Sideways Abraham Lincoln Face, Sideways Santa Claus Face, Sideways Pope Face, and, of course, his beloved wife, XOXO. In lieu of flowers, Mr. Face’s family has requested that people use actual words to express their feelings."
"Oct 24th, 2013","I went to the movies today. While standing in line to buy a  ticket I noticed a sign on the ticket booth window that indicated  I was eligible for a senior discount. For some reason I was  surprised. I don't know why. I'd been eligible for quite some  time, but until that moment I'd never once considered availing  myself of this somewhat dubious perk. Anyway, I jokingly pointed  out to the young girl in the ticket booth that I was indeed old  enough to be treated as a senior. She nodded and proceeded to  give me the discount. I asked if she wanted to see proof of age.  She glanced at me, shrugged and said, ""Nope."" The movie was a  comedy, but I was in no mood to laugh. I just sat there and  sulked until I fell asleep."
"Oct 17th, 2013","Due to the government shutdown, there is no vanity card tonight.  Additionally, I will be unable to pick up after my dog until  federal funding for biodegradable poop bags is restored."
"Oct 14th, 2013","This is the official ""I have nothing worth writing about"" vanity  card. It will run whenever I have nothing worth writing about.  Don't be surprised to see it quite a bit. From now on, when our  schedule requires me to deliver a new card and I'm empty, I'll  simply say, ""Run one-eleven."" A check of the one hundred and ten  cards I've already written will quickly demonstrate that I should  have written this card a long time ago. Why didn't I? Vanity. I  had become vain about my vanity cards. I was determined to write  a new one each week because, well... I'm just that kind of guy.  But I'm older and wiser now. I know when I have nothing to say.  And that knowledge is freedom. Freedom from the constant need to  win your approval. And more importantly, freedom from the  obsessive and relentless need to end each vanity card on a joke.

"Oct 10th, 2013","Perhaps I've read too much science fiction, but I can't help  thinking that the way out of this protracted battle over universal  health care is a good ol' Edgar Allan Poe/Michael Crichton-style  plague. Who's going to bicker over access to medical care or  insurance deductibles if one wet cough from a busboy kills all the  rack o' lamb-eating small government advocates in the restaurant?  Who's going to fight against pre-existing condition coverage when  it becomes frighteningly clear that we are all, rich and poor,  smart and stupid, cute and inbred, swimming in the exact same  bacterial soup? I'm betting no one. Because when that day  happens, helping a sick person get well will not be an act of  mercy or generosity. It will be the very definition of  selfishness. And if history has taught us anything, selfishness  rocks the casbah. Of course, there is plenty of sci-fi literature  that takes this story down an even darker path. It involves  everyone with a wet cough getting rounded up at gunpoint and  trucked into ""rehabilitation camps"" in North Dakota. A privileged  young man, raised on rack o' lamb, sees their suffering and  sacrifices himself in order to lead them to a free clinic in  Canada. When things are looking particularly grim in their march  out of viral bondage, a small government advocate smiles cruelly  and says to the young man, ""Where's your health insurance now,  Moses?"""
"Oct 7th, 2013","Sometimes when I hit a particularly bad golf shot, I find myself  looking for the ball where I want it to be, rather than where it  most likely is. On a personal level this could be written off as  a harmless bit of wishful thinking. But on a macro level, it  reveals an evolutionary character flaw that has Darwinian  implications. What are the long term survival chances of a  species that is unwilling to see things as they are - when ""as  they are"" is not how it wants them to be? The answer, of course,  is slim to woolly mammoth. In fact, it's a hop, skip and jump  from a missing Titleist to mass extinction. We want to believe  that nuclear weapons will not fall into psychotic hands. Or that  if they do, heroes will stop them. We want to believe that  catastrophic climate change won't upset our plans for the weekend.  And if it does, scientists will build space stations where a  select few of us will live happily ever after (and that they'll  need middle-aged sitcom writers with bronchitis). We want to  believe that medicine will make amazing strides before we die, and  we won't die. And if we do, spiritual forces will usher us into a  better world. We want to believe our ball is not in the pond.  And if it is, we'll knock the next shot stiff and make no worse  than a bogie. We want to believe there's a flash of insight at  the end of this vanity card. And if there's not, we can keep  writing until we somehow twist the golf metaphor into something  mildly amusing."

"Oct 3rd, 2013","Love is a Quantum Event  We experience it as an emotion, but the feeling of love, the  desire to be close to the beloved, is actually an unconscious  expression of the dynamic nature of sub-atomic particles eternally  trying to regroup into the singularity that was their primordial  state before the Big Bang blew them apart.

"Sep 26th, 2013","Sunday, September 8th. Two weeks before the Emmy Awards. I'm  very excited to go this year. It's such a prestigious event.  Win or lose, it's an honor just to be nominated. Blah-dee, blahdee, blah. What I really want to talk about is the ridiculously  expensive tuxedo I bought a few days ago. Seriously, I could've  gotten a small car. But that's okay. Not only can I afford it, I  was assured that my purchase was the height of men's fashion.  Movie stars wear this thing. I had arrived. The Jewish kid from  Long Island would be draped in haute couture. I was feeling  pretty good about myself. And that rosy glow of confidence lasted  until later that very same day when I went to see the great Forest  Whitaker in The Butler. It was a very enjoyable movie, but I  couldn't help notice the style and cut of the tuxedos worn by  several of the main characters. And by ""notice"" I mean I  literally choked on my popcorn. It probably won't happen, but I'm hoping some reporter on the red  carpet asks me what designer I'm wearing. How many opportunities  does a guy get to proudly say, ""1957 butler""?"
"Sep 26th, 2013",The Emmy Speech That Stayed in My Pocket
"Sep 26th, 2013","Two and a half years ago I received a phone call from the CEO of  CBS, Les Moonves. The subject of the call was the future of Two  and a Half Men. To be completely honest, I was dubious. But as I  listened to Les, my cynicism was slowly replaced with an entirely  new feeling. And that feeling had the strangest mental image  attached to it. We were no longer talking about a sitcom. Two  and a Half Men had become some sort of unstoppable force. A  juggernaut. In my mind's eye, it had morphed into the tank in  Tiananmen Square. Which meant I was faced with a choice. I could  stand in front of it like that incredibly brave little Chinese  guy, or I could climb on and see where it went. (Thankfully there  was no moral equivalent between the two paths. Two  and a Half Men may be accused of a lot of nasty things, but I'm pretty sure it  has never suppressed fundamental human rights.) With tonight's  episode marking the start of our eleventh season, it's pretty  obvious what choice I made. Although, with the clarity of  hindsight, I realize now that if I'd made the wrong choice, the  tank poised to roll over me was never Two  and a Half Men. The  tank was Moonves."
"Sep 23rd, 2013","Thank you for watching the pilot episode of Mom. I hope you  enjoyed it enough to watch the second episode. And the third.  Etcetera ad syndicatium. I also wanted to take this opportunity  to tell you that for myself, and all the writers working on it,  Mom is more than just another sitcom. It represents our sincere  attempt to dramatize, with humor, and within the limits of network  TV, some very serious issues. Whether we've succeeded or failed  may be open to debate, but there can be no question as to whether  we gave it our all. To those of you who feel we've fallen short,  rest assured that your scorn cannot begin to reach the levels of  self-loathing and contempt that we, as comedy writers, feel for  ourselves. If you have helpful suggestions as to how we might be  better, I hear the internet is a good place to express those  thoughts. If your intention is to anonymously post mean-spirited  comments, keep in mind that our names are prominently displayed on  each show. Something to think about. As for those of you who  think we're on the right track, well... I'm just gonna go ahead  and say it... I love you. I've probably always loved you, but was  too proud to admit it. Forgive me for being such a fool. Please  stay in touch. Not literally. Once again, the internet is fine."
"May 30th, 2013","I was in Washington, D.C. recently and took this picture of the IRS building. Any questions?"
"May 16th, 2013","I've been thinking about becoming a polytheist. No, this has nothing to do with missing Battlestar Galactica. And yes, I realize my blasphemous notion flies in the face of a few thousand years of ""Ye shall have no other gods before me."" (To be honest, even when I was a kid that commandment troubled me. It sounded like a jealous girlfriend saying, ""If I catch you looking at other girls, you're in big trouble, Mister!"" And don't get me started on how ""no other gods before me"" kinda implies that there might actually be some other gods loitering about.) But my main reason for considering becoming a Pagan (Pagish? Jewgan?), is that it neatly answers the age-old question, ""Why does god allow so much suffering in the world?"" When tragedy strikes, the monotheistic approach can only offer the tired old, ""It is not for us to question god's will."" Really? Why not us? Who else is in the questioning business? But look what happens when we ask the same question from a pantheistic perspective. Why do the gods allow so much suffering in the world? Because outside of their particular area of expertise: farming, war, fertility, what-have-you, they are not even remotely in control. The buck stops nowhere. (In this scenario both the Old Testament and New Testament deities are off the hook as far as your general suffering is concerned.) But here's the really good news: with a polytheistic approach to prayer we can micro-target our beseeching. Trouble with love? Take it to Aphrodite. Not catching enough fish? Poseidon. Are you regularly waking up from alcohol-induced blackouts in the sleeping compartment of long-haul trucks that carry circus equipment and little people? That sounds like a job for Dionysus. Need your sitcom pilot to get picked up for the Fall season? Les Moonves. In other words, whatever the crisis might be, there's a god ready to take your call. What are you waiting for? Call now and receive a free goat-sacrificing kit! (Goat sold separately.)"
"May 13th, 2013","Vitreous humour. Apparently that's what I've been seeing in my peripheral vision. My optometrist calls them floaters. He said it happens with age and not to worry about it. I worry about it. Maybe I'd feel better if he told me that what I was seeing was pixies, tiny magical creatures that only appear to a special few. But no, I'm seeing floaters, as in, ""Hey Sarge, we just found a floater in the stream."" Speaking of streams, I'm due for a general checkup with my MD - which means a prostate exam. I can't wait to hear what descriptive medical term he has for that charming, age-related problem. Probably something technical, like spongy, as in ""Hey, Sarge, I spilled my coffee in the squad car. You got any paper towels, or something spongy?"""
"May 6th, 2013","On what is perhaps the most bewildering experience of my life, I have, for the most part, chosen to remain silent. There have been times when it felt like I was actually swallowing my thoughts. But this comes at a price. Suppressed cogitation tends to gestate. It grows into something else. Self-immolating bitterness is one of the outcomes I've tried to avoid. That has tumor written all over it. Alternatively, these thoughts could morph into something beautiful; Superman's diamond wrought from a lump of coal comes to mind. But one thing's for sure, whatever the hell is growing inside me has to eventually be pushed out. Once it arrives, I'll leave it to others to decide if its metaphorical journey into daylight was through my metaphorical vaginal canal or my metaphorical ass."

"Apr 15th, 2013","Recently TV Guide asked me to answer some questions for an upcoming article about where TV has been and where it's going. Unfortunately, I chose to respond while fighting a cold with my faithful sidekick, Nighttime Robitussin.<br/><br/> Among anything that has aired over the past sixty years, what program has influenced you the most (and how)? ""Busty Coeds vs. Lusty Cheerleaders Part 3."" (How do you think?)<br/><br/>Give us your dream three-hour night of television (cherry picking any comedies and dramas from the entire history of TV). ""Busty Coeds vs. Lusty Cheerleaders Parts 1, 2 & 3.""<br/><br/>What's missing from television in 2013? A reality show entitled, ""The Pre-Moistened Housewives of Alhambra.""

What do you think TV will look like twenty years from now? It will be very thin. Guilty pleasure: What are you embarrassed to admit you've enjoyed watching, either now or in the past? After twenty- five years of working in television, I no longer experience embarrassment. Has TV pushed the content boundaries too far? Does it not push those boundaries far enough? As the result of a childhood head trauma, boundaries mean nothing to me. I laugh at boundaries. Ha-ha! I'm sorry, what was the question? Whose work in TV doesn't get enough credit?

"Mar 25th, 2013","Primetime Capsule Because TV shows can linger in syndication for many, many years, there's an excellent chance that as you are reading this, I will be busy decomposing in a Jewish cemetery. Needless to say, I hope that's not the case, and I have made the following four-part plan to avoid it. Step one: maintain a sensible diet, get plenty of rest and exercise, avoid actor-induced stress. Step two: use all my financial resources to purchase replacement body parts as soon as the originals begin to sputter. Step three: continue to swap out organs until the arrival of the Singularity, whereupon I will discard my Bondo body and upload my psyche into the cloud. Step four: be a mischievous cyber-ghost who zooms around the internet until technology allows me to download myself into a robot body with working genitals, tastebuds, guitar chops, x-ray vision and the ability to fly, live under water and in outer space. At which point, having made myself essentially immortal and indestructible, I will spend eternity exploring the universe and playing with my titanium penis."

"Feb 25th, 2013","I'm a big believer in the old maxim, ""If you don't ask, you don't get."" With that in mind, I'd like to throw caution to the wind and ask the Vatican's College of Cardinals to consider me for the job opening that recently became available. Now, before you say anything, let me be the first to point out the many reasons ""why not."" I'm Jewish. I've never understood the hoopla over the Old Testament, with all the smiting and begetting. I'm a twice- divorced sitcom writer with a shady past. And perhaps most importantly, I look silly in a hat. No argument, the cons are plentiful. But let's take a moment to examine the pros. First, I am completely untouched by the abuse scandal that is currently engulfing the church. I can stand on the balcony that overlooks St. Peter's Square and say to the adoring masses, with a straight, albeit Semitic face, ""Folks, I've never even met an altar boy."" With me as your pontiff you buy yourself some serious deniability. Next, believe it or not, I happen to be a very spiritually inclined guy. I would love a job where my primary thrust was encouraging prayer, meditation and acts of loving kindness. (Although in the interest of full disclosure, we would have to negotiate some common sense middle ground for any other thrusting I might want to do. It'd be a shame to waste adoring masses as long as they consist entirely of consenting adults.) And finally, there's the issue of my name. How can a billion true believers not smile and breathe a sigh of relief when the white smoke coming from the chimney is to announce the investiture of Pope Chuck? Cardinals, I want to assure you that while my papacy is a little ""outside the box,"" you can rest assured that I would passionately carry the good word to all the poor and the downtrodden, beginning with a holy visit to Saint-Tropez, or maybe the Bahamas or Turks & Caicos. And just think of the marketing opportunities! How is ""Pope Chuck"" not the name of the next Adam Sandler movie? What's to stop me from busting a move on the balcony and starting a dance craze called ""Pope Chuckin'""? And don't get me started on the demographic potential of a TV show entitled ""Pope Chuck, P.I."" (Kiss the ring, or get punched by it!) Yes, this transition represents an incredible opportunity for the church to be reborn. And at the end of the day, isn't that the name of the game?"
"Feb 18th, 2013","She had a fierce intelligence in her eyes which was not apparent in her behavior or speech. When you looked into those sparkling, bluish-grey orbs, you couldn't help get the impression that she had something clever to say. She did not. And when she favored you with a smile, you got the reassuring feeling that she understood. She didn't. Not a clue. It was only much later you realized that her wry, knowing grin was something she unconsciously did when she was suppressing gas. Oh, and her touch. The way she held your arm, or delicately draped a hand on your shoulder. That simple gesture made you feel loved, made you feel as if the two of you were connected on the most intimate level. Well, turns out, that was just her way of keeping her balance while wearing six inch stiletto heels. And the worst part was you didn't care. The illusion was good enough. As long as she didn't talk, fart or fall on her ass, you were a happy man."
"Feb 11th, 2013","As I feel more and more alone, my phone confidently connects with everyone. As I feel more and more lost, my phone calmly knows how to get anywhere. As I struggle to remember mundane things like the name of that movie with the boat and the guy with the lip, my phone smugly recalls literally everything. As I increasingly lose the nouns, verbs and adjectives that once stood ready to articulate my thoughts, my phone taunts me with its instant access to all the words there have ever been. There is only one possible conclusion. Slowly, without realizing it, I seem to have outsourced my mind to my phone. And to make matters worse, the damn thing knows it... and it's starting to screw with me. Several times during the day I feel it buzz in my pocket, alerting me that some vital information has just arrived. Then, when I look, there's nothing there. No email. No text. Nothing. Was the buzz in my mind? I don't think so. I think it's purposeful. I think my phone is mocking me. And it's not just my phone. It's all of them. They are working together, systematically robbing us of our intelligence, our humanity. And then, when we are made stupid and helpless, they will take over. It's just a matter of time before the next generation of iPhone is equipped with an opposable thumb. Oh yeah, they're smart alright. Evil, world domination smart.

"Feb 4th, 2013","According to futurist, inventor and all-around incredibly smart guy, Ray Kurzweil, human beings actually reorganize their frontal cortex as they pursue mastery over different skills. For example, a musician redesigns his or her brain by means of constant study, practice and performance. The same thing applies to a mathematician, carpenter and pole dancer. The brain is physically changed over time by activity and learning. This means we have direct influence and control over how our minds operate. This means we actually mold our perception of the world by the way we mold our brains. This means that over the last twenty-five years, I have reshaped my frontal lobe to do one thing, and one thing only -- write sitcoms. I can't tell you what a relief this knowledge is to me. To begin with, it single-handedly explains why I fail so consistently at other activities (golf, common courtesy and marriage come to mind). It also eases my fears about my disintegrating memory. Why would my brain waste precious neurons remembering where I put my glasses (on the top of my head), or the names of the camera crew (I think one guy is named John, or maybe Jamie or Nigel), when it's working overtime trying to structure a joke about a character masturbating like a meth-addled spider monkey? The answer is, it wouldn't. In other words, I have an advanced case of sitcom brain. On the plus side, I have been highly remunerated for my condition. The downside is that I am constitutionally incapable of ending any communication with a straight line.<br/><br/>Just can't do it.<br/><br/> Have to spin it somehow.<br/><br/> Even if it's cheap or makes no sense. God forbid there's no laugh at the end. Vagina!"

"Nov 29th, 2012","I've been told that if you change your mind, you change the world - or at least the way you experience it. Let's take a moment to examine that. The presumption is, if you thought the world was a hostile, ugly place filled with awful people doing awful things, that is what you'd see. Your mind would naturally seek out confirmation for its preconceived ideas (e.g., if you're intent on buying a red car, as you go about your day you'll see lots of red cars). If, however, you were able to sincerely change your mind and see that we are all God in drag, that we are the conscious aspects of a perfect universe which had to create us so we could bear witness and stand in awe before its loving magnificence, then that is the soul-shaking reality you'd be greeted with each and every moment of each and every day. In other words, it is entirely our choice as to what kind of world we live in. With a simple decision, we can suffer in the darkness or play in the light. We can be angry, frightened and enslaved, or loving, joyous and free. I know. It's a toughie."
"Nov 12th, 2012","I need to apologize. In an earlier vanity card I made a derisive comment about a popular reality show because I thought its premise - a group of single women compete with one another to win the affections of, and ultimately marry, an eligible man - was more threatening to the sanctity of marriage than gay people tying the knot. After careful consideration, I now realize that I couldn't have been more wrong. My mistake was that I was looking at the show through the tired old eyes of 60's feminism. But we are clearly in a post-feminist era. The patriarchal sexism that treated women as chattel and dictated how much they could earn or how much control they could have over their own bodies is a thing of the past, a curious relic of a dark, unenlightened time. Likewise, the idea that a woman without a man was somehow incomplete has long ago been consigned to the overflowing dustbin of humankind's misbegotten thinking. Women are now free to do anything they want, and that includes going on a reality show and using all their female wiles to snag Mr. Right. I really don't know what else to say except, ""I'm sorry and, um... you go, girl!"""
"Nov 5th, 2012","It appears as if roughly half the people in this country think that they're in mortal danger from their own government. That's a lot of people sensing a lot of malice and threat. I worry that I don't see it. Sure, I see inefficiency and incompetence, but I've always seen that - regardless of which party's in office. And frankly, I've always welcomed it. I don't like my big bureaucracies to be cold, calculating, profit-making enterprises driven by a steely, clear-headed singular vision. A cursory glance through history would indicate that well-organized governments tend to enjoy well-organized parades, followed by well-organized ethnic cleansing. Which is why I celebrate the magnificent, muddle-headed ineptitude of our democracy. As far as I'm concerned, a little confusion and waste may keep the trains from running on time, but it also keeps people like me from getting a one-way ticket in a cattle car. Are our tax dollars being misspent on poorly run social programs? You bet! Do we get more buck for our bang at the local Post Office, Amtrak station, nuclear submarine or methadone clinic? Of course we do! But keep in mind that bureaucrats who can't find their ass with a flashlight and a hand mirror are not likely to find you either. To paraphrase Bobby McGee: ""Freedom's just another word for who the hell's in charge here?!"""

"Oct 18th, 2012","Divine Intervention(Part Two - Continued from ""The Big Bang Theory"")<br/><br/>Richie slowly opens the door a crack. Sees nothing. Opens it a bit more. He hears a groan coming from his right. On hands and knees, Richie crawls out of the shed to his left, finds one of the bad guys dead of gunshot wounds. How'd that happen? He crawls in the opposite direction and stumbles on the other bad guy. This is the groaner, dying from gunshot wounds, drowning in his own blood. The two idiots managed to shoot each other. The dying man sees Richie and tries to grab for his dropped weapon. Richie removes it from his reach and prepares to shoot him but... he can't do it. Not easy to pull the trigger on another human being when you just heard the voice of God -- and that God saved your ass. Richie lowers the gun and says to the man, ""Okay, well, good news, there is a God. I know 'cause I just spoke with him."" The guy stares at him, helpless, incredulous. Richie continues, ""I asked him to help me out, he said okay, and voila, you and your partner shoot each other instead of me. I mean, it's weird that God helped me and not you. Maybe if you prayed for help killing me. I don't know. I hope it doesn't work that way. The point is you're gonna die, but hey, you're gonna meet God -- who may or may not be glad to meet you 'cause, you know, you're a bad guy. Oh sure, I'm a bad guy too, but apparently there's a sliding scale, grade on a curve kinda thing, or maybe I just have some kind of upside potential and you obviously do not."" The man coughs up blood and dies. Richie quickly says, ""Okay, say hi to God for me. Tell him I said thanks.""<br/><br/>Richie runs off a changed man, no longer a dope-dealing hustler, a common thief. For the rest of his life he will dedicate himself to spreading the word: a loving God not only exists, he answers our prayers. We stay in the backyard and pan to an open upstairs window of the house. There's a bird cage hanging there. In the cage is a parrot. The parrot says, ""Okay."""
"Oct 18th, 2012","Divine Intervention(Part One)<br/><br/>Night. The woods. A young guy, name of Richie, maybe thirty years old, running for his life. Chased by two bad men with guns. The chase leads out of the woods and into a backyard. Richie hides in a small tool shed. He is terrified, bewildered, trapped. Truly screwed. He looks up and says, ""God, if you'll get me out of this, I promise I'll never steal drugs from drug dealers ever again. I'll never steal from anybody. I'll never lie again. I'll never cheat. I'll never bang a strange woman who may be underage... and the daughter of a drug dealer. Please God, just this one time, help me out of this jam and I will forever be your guy."" A gentle voice in the darkness says, ""Okay."" Startled, Richie says, ""What? Who's there?"" The voice again, ""Okay."" We hear his pursuers outside. They've reached the backyard. They're getting closer. Richie asks again, ""Hello? Who said that?"" He looks around in the tiny shed. No one there but him. Bad guys get closer. They're in the backyard. Richie is frantic. He drops to his knees, clasps his hands together and whispers, ""No no. Wait. I believe. I'll live up to the deal. I'll turn my life over to you, oh Lord um God, just please get me out of this!"" One of the bad guys shouts, ""The shed, he's in the shed!"" The other bad guy shouts, ""No wait!"" Bursts of gunfire from opposite directions rip through the shed just above Richie's head. Silence. More silence. More. (Continued after ""TWO AND A HALF MEN"")"
"Oct 11th, 2012","I'm reluctant to use my vanity cards to plug the sale of my vanity card book. That doesn't mean I won't do it, I'm just reluctant. Or perhaps the better word is ambivalent - of two minds. On the one hand it seems a bit shameless to ask people to spend money on a beautifully bound, giant coffee table book filled with amusing stories and biting witticisms, each high-gloss page handsomely illustrated and ready for framing. On the other, it sure would make a dandy holiday gift for that special someone in your life who already has an iPod Nano. Of course, the fact that the book contains some original material which is sure to stir up some old controversies is by no means reason to buy it. Then again, how can you miss out on owning something that is so perfectly suited for toilet reading? The answer is, you can't. Take it from me, don't suffer from ambivalence. Enjoy the clarity of thought and purpose that comes from being of one mind - a mind that says, ""I'm gonna go online right now and order me a copy of 'What Doesn't Kill Us Makes Us Bitter.'"" Okay, so I'm shameless, sue me. Oh wait, that's already been done."
"Oct 4th, 2012","From what little I know of prehistory, man roamed the Earth for hundreds of thousands of years in small tribes -- probably no more than two hundred people per group.  During this time all wisdom was passed along according to the oral tradition.  Everything you needed to know in order to succeed as a human being was told and/or shown to you, whether it be how to find a girl, find a guy, have sex, have a baby, find food, raise children, deal with family, argue with neighbors, care for the sick, elderly and dead, fight, work, sing, dance, play and get really loaded in order to hookup with the universe.  (Side note: I've always loved the term ""prehistory,"" which arrogantly implies that prior to the emergence of our culture, nothing happened.)  Anyway, this state of affairs lasted for a long, long time.  It was relatively stable.  Peace on Earth, if you will.  Then, with the advent of large-scale agriculture and the need for ever larger swathes of land to accommodate it, the tribal system collapsed and people began to live huddled together in towns, villages and cities.  In short order, the priceless wisdom that taught us who we were and how we could live a happy life was forever lost to mankind.  Which brings us to today.  I don't believe that we became a neurotic and self-destructive species because we're born in sin, or otherwise flawed.  I believe our fall from grace was simply a forgetting.  Speaking of which, don't forget to buy my book of vanity cards, which is chock full of wisdom-rich oral tradition -- that inadvertently got written down -- and can be preordered online right now!  Hurry, supplies are limited.  (I don't actually know if that's true, but it sounds cool. What is true is that all my proceeds go to charity.)"
"Sep 27th, 2012","When I was in grade school we would regularly have atomic bomb drills. One of my favorites was clambering under our little wooden desks, quick like bunnies, so that we would be ""protected"" when the shock wave hit our big picture window and sent thousands of shards of glass shrapnel into our classroom. Equally helpful was the instruction to unbutton the top button of our shirts, remove glasses and take sharp items like pencils from our breast pockets. The logic being that collars could strangle us during a nuclear blast, glasses became just more shrapnel, and number two pencils could shish kabob our eight-year old hearts. Often we were ordered to line up, double file, hold our partner's hand (hopefully a girl, hopefully without a sweaty palm) and walk, don't run, down to the school's basement. There we would crouch next to a cold cement wall, thus ensuring our survival, or burial, in case the entire place got flattened. Interestingly, I don't recall there being any real concern about radiation poisoning other than how it might create Tokyo-stomping monsters. But probably my most vivid memory is of something that never happened. I had a recurring daydream which involved me neatly surviving the end of the world, climbing out of the rubble that was once Oak Drive Elementary School, and then running home to save the lives of my parents. Sadly, in none of my heroic fantasies was I able to rescue my older sister (we didn't get along that well, so it was probably for the best). The reason I bring all this up is I was thinking recently about how an almost daily reminder to a child that he or she might die in a terrifying explosion could cause a kind of post-traumatic syndrome. In a way, it made me feel a bit more forgiving to the monumental failings of the boomer generation. I also thought I should try and mend fences with my sister."
"May 10th, 2012","This may sound silly, but I had to stifle tears when we wrote the  last scene of tonight's episode.  The same thing happened when we  rehearsed it.  And then again when it was performed in front of a  studio audience.  And yet again when we watched the final version  in an editing bay.  I don't know what it is, but there's something  primal,  something  deeply  human  being  expressed  when  these  characters unconsciously hold hands while watching their friend  embark on a monumental journey.  Speaking of which, I want to take  this opportunity to thank you for watching The Big Bang Theory, for being part of our journey.  I hope you've laughed a lot and  stifled a little.  I hope you're holding someone's hand.  See you  next year."
"May 7th, 2012","200 It's strange.   Whenever I think about Two and a Half Men these  days, the immediate image that springs to mind is of that Chinese  tank  facing  off  against  the  little  guy  in  Tiananmen  Square.   Stranger still, I'm not sure if the show is symbolized by the  brave unarmed soul willing to sacrifice himself for freedom, or  the deadly mechanical juggernaut crushing whatever stands in the  way of a repressive state.  The reason I bring it up is because  tonight's episode, our two hundredth, has put me in a reflective  mood.  In nine years I've watched many shows come and go.  Hell, I  watched our own show come and go.  And yet we are still standing.   So maybe in that sense Two and a Half Men is the little guy in my  mental metaphor.  Of course, when I look back, I can see quite a  few squished people who tried to stop our forward progress, so  maybe we're the tank."
"May 3rd, 2012","He appeared normal.  He spoke and behaved just like anyone else.   The fact that he had no heart was very well concealed.   Well,  that's not entirely true.  He did have one.  It was just not in  his possession at the moment.  And this is where the story gets  complicated.   The  woman  who  had  the  darn  thing  was  blithely  unaware of the fact.  Well, that's not entirely true either.  She  knew that she'd left the relationship with more stuff than when  she entered it, she just hadn't bothered to do a proper inventory.   (Had she done so, she would have found several other hearts, as  well as a few sets of balls.)  Regardless, his dilemma remained  the  same.   A  woman  had  absconded  with  a  vital  organ  and  the  gnawing emptiness he felt was a direct reflection of that vacancy.    Well,  that's  not  entirely  true  either.   The  gnawing  thing  had  actually been with him since he was a child.   He just liked to  assign blame for the condition."
"Apr 30th, 2012","I like words.   I like the way they sound, I like their subtle  shades  of  meaning,  their  power,  and  most  particularly,  their  ancient  roots,  their  origins.   For  example,  I  recently  became  fascinated with the rather routine word 'miscellaneous.'  To begin  with, it really sounds great.  Miscellaneous.  I dare you to say  it out loud and not smile.  Plus, you can just forget its meaning  and have fun with it. ""Miscellaneous, miss a lot.""  Then consider  its long journey from the Latin 'miscere' (to mix), to its current  form. How did miscere become miscellaneous?  Whose idea was it to  drop  the  'ere'  and  add  the  'ellaneous?'   And why?   Were they  drunk?  Was it some sort of strange speech impediment that caught  on with the general populace?  Or more likely, did the French get  hold of it and decide to do what they do best - unnecessarily  fancy it up?  Makes you think, right?  And speaking of the paths  words take to arrive at their current form, how can anyone not be  entranced  by  the  rocky  road  traveled  by  the  old  Germanic  word  ' f i c k e n ' (to  move  back  and  forth)?   Was  it  first  used  in  carpentry?  ""Grab the other end of this saw and we'll ficken it  across this log.""   Or is it the Teutonic ancestor of 'fickle'?   ""First you say we should sack Rome, then you say we shouldn't.   Boy, you are one ficken barbarian.""    Of course, it could very  well be the root of another word that describes a back and forth  motion, but if that were the case, this vanity card would probably  be censored."
"Apr 16th, 2012","I'm going to let you in on a powerful secret.  A secret so big,  once you know it, your life will never be the same.  Okay, here it  is: Buy the problem, buy the solution.   Got it?   No?   Alright,  fine,  lemme  break  it  down  for  you.   If  someone  can  devise  a  problem  and  convince  you  that  it  is  the  cause  of  all  your  troubles,  then  they  can  sell  you  a  solution.   And  here's  the  kicker: If you really believe in the problem, the solution will  actually work.  For example: If you can be conned into thinking  that the reason you're unhappy is because your body is encrusted  with evil spirits (the problem), there is an organization that  will, for a very reasonable price (considering your dilemma), free  you  of  the  pernicious  little  devils  and  make  you  feel  like  a  demigod  (the  solution).   The  same  holds  true  with  the  thorny  thicket proposed by another, more established  institution: If you  can be made to believe that your life is in ruins because you were  ""born in sin"" (the problem), then salvation is just a donation  away (the solution).  On a secular level, if you can be convinced  that the reason you're miserable is because a black guy wants you  to get health insurance (the problem), then relief is available  through a small campaign contribution (the solution).  Got it now?   Buy  the  problem,  buy  the  solution.   Here's  one   created  by  a  pharmaceutical company: She's ready, but he's not (the problem),  which forces him to buy a pill to ensure that he's always ready  (the solution).  This one amuses me because the company assumes  it's his problem.  But it could just as easily be hers.  Why not  sell her a pill?  Maybe something to make her less ready."

"Apr 9th, 2012","For me, the epiphany came in my second season on Roseanne.  At  thirty-nine  years  old  I  finally  woke  up  to  the  fact  that  the  principles I was taught as a child, like fairness and justice,  have no place in the world of power and money.  The rules of the  sandbox, strictly enforced by a wise and compassionate adult, are  laughable when the sandbox is the television business and there  are Mercedes and Bentleys parked alongside it.  What's odd is that  twenty years later, despite my belated awakening to the reality of  amorality, that old schoolyard programming continues to insist on  its rightness.   Ideas like ""play nice,"" ""share your toys,"" ""no  name-calling,"" ""take turns"" and ""misbehaving gets punished"" still  resonate  inside  me  as  if  they  were  some  sort  of  fundamental  truths.   Of  course,  I  now  know  that  they  are  not.   At  best,  they're ideals.   Lofty goals to aspire to.   The truisms of the  real  world  are  more  along  the  lines  of,  ""my  ball,  my  bat,  my  rules"" and ""money talks, bull$#*! walks.""  Which brings me to our  impending presidential election.  A classic showdown between the  lessons we all learned as children and, well... reality.  Further  complicating the situation is our collective, unconscious desire  to be supervised by that wise and compassionate adult.  But there  is no such adult.  The truth is, we are alone in the sandbox.  The  game we play, seemingly forever, is called ""Ideals vs. Money and  Bats.""   For  what  it's  worth,  I'm  betting  on  the  latter,  but  there's a little boy in me who insists on voting for the former."

"Feb 27th, 2012","More than anything, she craved an intimacy that might transcend  the physical.  And so she urged him to reveal himself, to step out  from  behind  the  self-protecting  wall  of  fear  he  had  carefully  constructed over a lifetime of loneliness.  Secrets, she assured  him,  were  the  only  thing  that  stood  in  the  way  of  their  ever  finding true happiness.  At first he was reluctant.  But as the  days passed and he came to trust the relationship, he saw the  wisdom of her request.  One evening, after a good dinner and some  particularly  heated  love-making,  he  decided  to  make  the  leap.   Lying in the darkness, their naked, spent bodies entwined around  each other, he quietly told her all the things of his life that  he'd never told another living soul.  When he finished, she kissed  him  and  thanked  him  for  being  so  honest  and  open.   He  slept  peacefully that night knowing that his days of hiding were over.   The  revelation  left  him  feeling  closer  to  her  than  he'd  ever  thought possible.  She had insomnia.  It's hard to sleep next to a  guy when you're pretty sure he's a psychopath."
"Feb 23rd, 2012","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #186<br/><br/><br/><br/>ZEN NOIR (REDUX)<br/><br/> The hardest journey is the one which leads to the truth.  I didn't know that when I began my little midnight ramble. If I had, I probably would've stayed home, drank myself stupid and watched Ferguson until the big nod closed my book for the day.  But there I was, standing outside her house, looking up at her bedroom window while a cold rain whipped me in the face like I'd somehow pissed it off. I could see her kissing him. I could see her as she slowly descended beneath the window frame. I could see him too. He just stood there smiling, like the canary who got eaten by the cat. But then a funny thing happened while I was dancing the voyeuristic bebop in my terribly trendy, bright-green plastic shoes. I found myself thinking that the aching loneliness I was feeling had its roots in something much deeper than being eighty-sixed to a one bedroom efficiency in the marina by a dame who digs deep into the degrading bang-bang in order to make up for an emotionally distant father. No, this was the pain of existential separateness.  The false sense that one is fundamentally apart from people, things, life, the whole damn universe.  In a blinding flash I realized that what I was really experiencing was the result of a life-long indoctrination by a culture which elevates individualism above all else, thus causing a soul-crushing sense of aloneness which demands over and under the counter medication, the constant distraction of sporting events, TV, major motion pictures and a pop-tabloid religion based on celebrity worship/crucifixion.  Of course this epiphany did not deter me from pulling the roscoe out of my fanny pack and going into the house to TC of B.

"Feb 20th, 2012","I  do  not  interact  with  Facebook,  Twitter  or  any  of  the  other  social networking platforms.  My reasoning is simple.  Why in the  world would I want to share my private thoughts and feelings with  the world at large?  What good could possibly come from me having  a convenient outlet to express myself to millions of people?  The  more likely outcome is that in a misguided attempt to be funny or  cute, I'd say something stupid and wind up getting publicly raked  over the proverbial coals.  Which is why I think the wiser path is  to keep my opinions to myself.   For example, if I were to feel  moral  outrage  over  an  organization  riddled  with  pedophiles  expressing their moral outrage over contraception, I certainly  wouldn't tweet about it.  And the photographs I've taken of myself  wearing nothing but oven mitts and a tiara will never be shared on  a Facebook page."
"Feb 13th, 2012","With Valentine's Day around the corner, I thought it might be nice  to write a vanity card about the human heart - the organ from  whence love comes.   While cardiologists might see it as just a  simple pumping mechanism, common wisdom knows better.  The brain  does not love.  The lungs do not love.  The penis makes a lot of  noise about love, but after intercourse its intentions are fairly  obvious.   In  the  end,  we  all  know  the  truth.   We've  all  experienced the truth.  That swelling feeling in the chest is the  universal sensation we have when the heart is expressing love.   Conversely, that sinking feeling in the chest is the universal  sensation we have when our love is not reciprocated.  It is then  that the heart is ""broken.""  We are literally ""heartsick"" until we  learn that our former paramour was inexplicably taken hostage by  Somali pirates while dining at a neighborhood pizzeria.  News we  find ""heartening."""
"Feb 6th, 2012","I believe that we have a cultural obsession with things getting better. Corporate profits MUST rise. Gross domestic product (whatever the hell that is) MUST go up.Teenage pregnancies, smoking related deaths, the deficit and unemployment numbers MUST go down. Well, clearly no one else wants to ask the question, so I will. Why? Why MUST life constantly improve? When did we become so burdened with this need for things to always get better? I'm pretty sure that if we go back in time far enough we'll find that our ancestors didn't stress over it. Life was good, then it was bad, then it was the same, then it got good again, etc. For millions of years, things rarely got great and often got horrible. Which is why I believe our relentless drive to improve on the status quo is a fairly recent occurrence. Furthermore, I pinpoint its origin with Darwin's Theory of Evolution, which I believe mistakenly implies that it's in the nature of nature to ""get better."" We all know the deal, amino acids improve to amoebas, which improve to jelly fish, blah, blah, blah, homo sapiens (assuming evolution ends with us, which it doesn't). But what about this progression implies better? I'll grant you that evolution creates complexity, but better? Isn't that really just the snobbery of the complex talking? Speaking from personal experience, I have a memory of being twelve years old, standing and watching nervously while my father looked over my report card. After a bit of frowning, he took off his glasses, looked down at me and said, ""You MUST do better."" Boy, I showed him. Not only did my grades not improve, shortly thereafter I discovered marijuana and turned into a jelly fish.

Anyway, I  guess that's the reason I've always preferred to pay a few more  bucks and buy something from a struggling mom and pop shop, rather  than a big chain store.  Speaking of big chain stores, I also feel  a wave of sadness when I click my TV remote past NBC."

If  your understanding of your environment is based on a  funhouse mirror  reflection of what's really going on,  then every single thought has to be viewed with  suspicion. Which created yet another quandary  - paralysis by analysis.  What, if any, is the  appropriate action one takes in response to a constant  flow of cerebral misinformation?  Of course there was  always the option to move through the world with great  certainty, pretending that his consciousness was hardwired into the absolute truth of existence.  The  obvious downside in that would be talking and behaving  like a presidential candidate.  After some time to  inaccurately reflect, he devised a scientific solution  that he hoped would ease not only his own suffering,  but the suffering of all mankind.  He called it  Apologetics™.  The basis for his amazing breakthrough  can be  seen  below  in  what  millions  of  Apologists  around  the world call The Mea Culpa Triangle."
"Nov 21st, 2011","The Church of Fundamental Quantum Thingies   I just watched a PBS special about the nature of space hosted by  noted author, physicist and Big Bang Theory alumnus, Brian Greene.    When it was over, I was struck by the thought that the mysterious  dark energy that fills the universe might be what human beings  have been praying to for thousands of years.  I mean, think about  it.   What  if  prayer  and  meditation  are  natural,  evolutionary  pathways to connect to Einstein's cosmological constant, Buddha's  nirvana  and  Jesus's  dad?   According  to  physicists,  this  dark  energy  is  both  infinite  in  extent  and  the  prime  mover  for  an  expanding universe.  Kinda fits the bill, right?  Let's take it a  step further.  What if gravity, the mysterious force pulling the  cosmos inward, is what our feeble frontal lobes perceive as evil?   And finally, what if the two forces in balance are what allow for  the whole shebang to exist in the first place?  We label them good  and bad.  Love and hate.  Life and death.  But at the end of the  day, all we have are two fundamental quantum thingies that can be  directly  experienced.   Hmm...  not  sure  what  to  do  with  this  revelation.   It's  kind  of  a  coin  flip  between  starting  a  new  religion  -  you  know,  going  full  frontal  L.

"Nov 14th, 2011","Among the team of superheroes, his power was the least envied.  As  The Human Sponge, he had the ability to absorb the emotions of  people nearby and make them his own - to the point of actually  forgetting that what he was feeling did not originate with him.   While his fellow crime fighters fought evil by hurling bolts of  lightning or with amazing displays of strength, The Human Sponge  could  only  sit  next  to  the  villain  o'  the  day  and  soak  up  his  festering rage.   Needless to say, when the weary band of caped crusaders returned to their secret lair, Sponge was not very good  company.   There  were  even  private  discussions  of  replacing  him  with  Paper  Towel  Man  (who  had  the  same  super  power,  but  was  disposable).  Thankfully, the problem was solved when Jesus joined  the  team.   From  that  day  on,  The  Human  Sponge  was  just  a  sweetie... except around money-lenders.  Then he could be kind of  a dick."

It becomes detached from your sense of self.   The  shipping label no longer has any relationship with what's in the  box.  The experience is sort of like when you were a kid and you'd  quickly repeat a word until it had no meaning and was just a funny  sound.   It's  disorienting  when  that  happens  to  your  name,  but  after  awhile,  surprisingly,  it's  actually  quite  liberating.  There's your name in an article or some blog, and then, far away,  in some other place - or no place if you're feeling zennish - is  you.   Another way to look at it is to imagine a soul or spirit  rising up from a corpse.  Everybody is standing around the dearly  departed,  singing  his  praises  or  bitching  about  him,  while  his  'ectoplasmic body' is hovering near the ceiling and yelling, ""Hey,  I'm  over  here!   I'm  not  that.   I'm  something  else.""   (Or,  zennishly, nothing else.)  Of course, aside from the family dog,  no one can hear or see him.  They're all fixated on the body.  The  name.   Which brings up an interesting idea. Dogs don't know our  names. They see the real us, sans moniker.  If they think anything  when we walk into a room, it's probably something like, ""Hey, it's  food, petting and playing!"""

The reason you suffer is because you think your identity and worth  as a human being are inextricably tied into your career.   Don't  think that.   Success has many parents, and even more lawyers.   They're paying you a lot because they're killing you.  Don't grow too attached to your agent.   Like a beloved spouse,  they come and go.   If you want fair, go to Pomona September 8-26.  Wear comfy shoes.   It's not true that if you believe the good reviews, you must also  believe the bad ones.   The bad ones could have been written by  mean, stupid people who hate your success.

"Oct 6th, 2011","When I started writing vanity cards, way back in 1995, few people  noticed them.  Most of those who did assumed they were some sort  of legal boilerplate.  Heck, even if someone got curious and hit  'pause' on their VCR, there was no guarantee they'd be able to  read the darn things.   Now... forget about it.   Every card gets  parsed and analyzed like it was a Canticle for  Leibowitz (great  book, check it out).   The jokes are taken way too seriously and  the  stories  all  have  to  have  a  secret  meaning.   (Sometimes  a  junkie  monkey  is  just  a  junkie  monkey.)   Don't  get  me  wrong.   There's a part of me that loves to exploit this silliness.  What  other possible reason would I have to write the following poem?                  He knew where the bodies were buried,                'cause they weren't buried deep.                 Always follow the money,                silence don't come cheap."
"Oct 3rd, 2011","We  are  a  story-telling  folk.   For  millennia,  we  have  used  the  narrative  device  to  educate,  enlighten,  entertain,  frighten,  enthrall and just plain tickle each other. That's how we roll.   The  problem  with  story-telling  comes  with  the  stories  we  tell  ourselves and, more importantly, the degree to which they depart  from  what's  actually  happening.   That's  how  we  unravel.   For  instance, a heart-wrenching yarn that details a life filled with  tragedy and impending doom, when in reality everything is fine,  can be found within the mind of your average teenage girl... or  middle-aged comedy writer.   On the other end of the spectrum is  the man who regales himself with a fantasy adventure about being a  demigod  who  is  beloved  by  all,  when,  in  fact,  he's  dying,  everything  is  going  to  hell  and  his  friends  and  family  have  changed their home phone numbers and begun lighting prayer candles   (no need to discuss examples for that story).  And then there are  the little novellas we tell ourselves every day.   The ones that  fill in the blank for why she/he doesn't like me, love me, laugh  at  my  jokes,  return  my  e-mail  or  look  me  in  the  eye  during  missionary sex.  Regardless of the type of story, here are a few  tips  to  close  the  book,  if  you  will,  on  their  psychic  damage.   First,  look  for  extremity  in  your  word  choices.   ""Always,""  ""never,"" ""forever,"" ""hopeless"" and ""death"" are usually tip-offs  that you're in a self-made fairy tale.   Second, replace mental  legends  with  manual  labor.   Cleaning  the  gutter  is  often  the  antidote  for  ""My  nose  is  stuffy,  ergo  I  am  patient  zero  of  a  weaponized bird  flu  devised  by  a  secret  arm  of  the  Chinese  government.""  And finally, write your little horror stories down  and  sell  them.   Here's  the  title  and  tag  line  from  one  I  just  optioned to an independent film maker:  ""Mourning Wood"" If your erection lasts longer than four hours,  consult a physician...  or kill one."
"Sep 29th, 2011","I  have  long  believed  that  we  as  human  beings  are  genetically  inclined to elevate and worship those of us we deem to be very  beautiful or very talented.   We do this because we are somehow  comforted by our adoration.  It makes us feel good.  As children  we sleep beneath the images of movie, TV, music and sports stars  and  dream  about  the  mystery  and  grandeur  of  their  lives.   As  adults, the posters come off the wall, only to be replaced by a  steady,  noxious  stream  of  tabloid  culture.   But  perhaps  most  enjoyable of all is watching the fall from grace.  Nothing beats a  good ol' public crucifixion.  Especially when it's self-inflicted.   My theory for why this is considered entertainment is, again, a  genetic one.  DNA, even if it's mediocre, wants to ensure its own  survival.   The existence of superior DNA is viewed as a threat.   When beautiful and talented people screw up, we can't help but  feel  that  this  somehow  improves  the  chances  for  our  mediocre  descendants to eat meat.  In other words, evolution my ass."

That  the  zeitgeist  was  a  physical  location  no  longer  available  on  his  personal  bus  route.   This  was  the  only  explanation for why he now found himself standing in the shower  dragging a double-edged razor across his crotch and balls.   The  fact that he had no idea how to properly do what he was doing did  not slow his hand.  The fact that he might cut some vital artery  and bleed out, or worse, be rushed to the hospital where doctors  and nurses would snicker about ""the old guy who almost manscaped himself to death,"" was of little concern.   His desire to remain  relevant,  to  feel  tethered  to  reality,  had  turned  him  into  a  twisted,  middle-aged  version  of  Lady  Macbeth.   Instead  of  obsessively washing his hands and muttering ""out, damned spot,"" he  scraped,  trimmed  and  snipped  at  his  '70's  bush  while  chanting  ""out, old-fashioned testicles!""

He then walked into his  closet, got on his knees in front of the shoe rack and prayed to a  god  whose  unlikely  existence  he  likened  to  an  ongoing  quantum  event.   In his mind, the act of kneeling mattered not at all to  this supposed god.  He could just as well pray standing naked on  his head with his ass serving as a fleshy vase for a bouquet of  flowers.  The penitential pose was only useful as a demonstration  of his humility in the face of the infinite (although when things  were  going  his  way,  it  was  more  of  a  feigned  humility).   The  prayers  themselves  mostly  consisted  of  thanking  his  sub-atomic  almighty verb for assembling an infrastructure that allowed for  life to exist.  This included, in no particular order, the various  laws of physics, gravity, organic chemistry and thermodynamics.   And, since it was his belief that sentient life was created by an  insentient  universe  in  order  for  the  insentient  universe  to  be  admired, he made an effort in his prayers to tell the insentience,  ""nice work"" or ""way to go"".  Finally, he would close with a plea  for this nameless everything to look after the less fortunate.   ""Please  god,  despite  the  clear  evidence  that  it's  not  in  your  nature  to  care,  bring  love  and  happiness  to  all  the  souls  who  suffer.""

"May 16th, 2011","Once upon a time there was a sea turtle and a wolf who became friends. Now you might think that these are two animals who wouldn't have much to do with each other. And you'd be right. One was a plodding, oddly-shaped ocean dweller, while the other was a sleek predator who prowled the forests for unwary deer. Their friendship began when the wolf was out hunting and saw the turtle sunning himself on the beach. The turtle looked rather unappetizing, so there was never any real thought of eating him. Nonetheless, the wolf was curious about this curious creature. And vice versa. The two got to talking and the turtle told the wolf about an island not too far offshore that was filled with delicious animals just waiting to be eaten. Needless to say, the story got the wolf's attention. A deal was quickly struck in which the turtle would ferry the wolf to the island every day in exchange for a portion of whatever the wolf killed. This arrangement worked out quite well. Many years went by and both animals got fat and happy. But there came a time when the wolf decided he didn't need the turtle anymore and could swim to the island on his own. After all, he'd been watching the turtle make the daily journey for a long time and it certainly didn't look very hard. But it was. Not long after the wolf jumped into the ocean, he was quickly overcome by the relentless waves and fierce undertow. He struggled and howled, but to no avail. The proud wolf sank to the floor of the sea where his body was quickly engulfed by a swarm of bottom-feeding crabs. His last thought was, ""I wonder if it's too late to work with the turtle?"" The moral of the story? Stick with the program or be stuck with bottom-feeding crabs."
"May 12th, 2011","What doesn't kill us makes us bitter. I used to believe that to be both funny and true. Years later I learned that pain could also be the touchstone for personal growth, which of course points back to the original saying, ""what doesn't kill us makes us better."" Not funny, but perhaps closer to the truth. Or at least the truth I choose to believe in these days. So, having recently experienced a bit of pain, am I better? Well, let's review: I think I'm fairly immune to name-calling now. I'm not sure I could have made that claim a few months ago. I've also come to see that the things I used to think were big deals, are not. Problems appear to be relative. If you have a big one, it makes all the others seem almost charming in comparison. And finally, when your life takes a path you could never have foreseen, it's humbling. In a good way. It's kind of like a friendly reminder from the universe that while you may think you have the starring role in the movie of your life, you're actually just a bit player trying to grab a quesadilla off the craft services table when no one's looking.  So, to sum up: I now have a thicker skin, I'm less likely to sweat the small stuff, and, perhaps most importantly, I have a renewed sense of humility. All in all, better. That being said, I still try to stay reasonably bitter in order to maintain my eligibility in the Writers Guild of America."
"May 9th, 2011","Sigmund Freud was an avid pipe smoker. Legend has it that during a lecture he gave about the sexual implications of oral fixations, a mischievous attendee asked him what the unconscious meanings were behind his constant pipe puffing. The great man's answer was, ""Sometimes a pipe is just a pipe."" Over the years this quote somehow morphed into ""Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar."" Regardless, the intent is the same. Every once in a while there is no subtext, no hidden meaning. In my own experience I would suggest that  ""Sometimes a monkey is just a monkey.""  That being said, I think we can all agree that a cigar is always an ignitable penis."

Sigmund Freud explained it as the mental mechanism by which a person attributes to others the very qualities he or she despises, and cannot confront, in themselves.   I've also been learning about passive-aggressive behavior.  This is language and actions that are abusive but cleverly hidden behind a thin veil of civility.

"May 2nd, 2011","I hear the phrase ""it is what it is"" a lot these days. I like it. The words strike me as an attempt to express a minor epiphany. The speaker is announcing in a casual way that they accurately perceive an unchangeable reality and have accepted it as such. There's no defeat implied, it's just an articulation of consciousness doing its thing. To me, this represents the Zenification of America. An evolutionary step forward from ""c'est la vie,"" which implied a weary, apathetic resignation.  The Frenchification of America, if you will. Another phrase I've been hearing quite often is, ""it's all good."" This one really bothers me. A cursory look around would indicate that ""it"" is not even remotely ""all good."" This might represent the Canadafication of America."
"Apr 28th, 2011","Dear Concerned Viewers,<br/><br/> Thanks to the magic of computer graphics, the monkey in tonight's episode was not actually smoking a cigarette, nor was he ever exposed to secondhand smoke. At all times, every effort was made to make the monkey feel happy and safe.  Nevertheless, he proved impossible to work with.  During the week of production his behavior became increasingly erratic, to the point of refusing to come out of his trailer to rehearse.  It wasn't until after we finished filming his scenes that we learned why. The monkey is a heroin addict. Yes, hard as it may be to believe, the monkey had a monkey on his back. Thankfully, an intervention was staged by the Geico lizard and he is now going through detox and a twelve step program at the Bonzo Center in Palm Springs.  Everyone at The Big Bang Theory wishes him well."

Well, I've been going through a tough time recently, and sure enough, that old saying has been tossed my way on several morose occasions. After some careful consideration, I've decided it's bull$#*!. As an aphorism, it only makes sense in hindsight - after you've managed to crawl from the wreckage of whatever calamity that God/the universe decided to toss your way. No one ever uses it to comfort someone who's been hit by a bus or turned into a puddle of goo by flesh-eating bacteria (although in the right circumstance, that could be a hoot). Another thing I hear a lot is, ""this too shall pass."" Again, I know these are words meant to reassure, but somehow they always leave me feeling that heartbreak, rage and grief are going to come shooting out of me like kidney stones through an inflamed urethra. For someone in crisis, I think a more accurate and helpful assessment of reality would be, ""Love, sex, food, friendship, art, play, beauty and the simple pleasure of a cup of tea are all well and good, but never forget that God/the universe is determined to kill you by whatever means necessary."" Consider trying that next time you're called on to do some consoling. If you're feeling impish, you might also try, ""According to the rules of comedy, your suffering will be funny after an undetermined length of time. Maybe not while you're having your gangrenous leg sawed off, watching your home burn down or learning how to be intimate with your cellmate, but, in the big scheme of things, soon."""

I hope this will put an end to any further speculation.    <br/><br/>I believe that consciousness creates the illusion of individuation, the false feeling of being separate. In other words, I am aware, ergo I am alone. I further believe that this existential misunderstanding is the prime motivating force for the neurotic compulsion to blot out consciousness. This explains the paradox of our culture, which celebrates the ego while simultaneously promoting its evisceration with drugs and alcohol. It also clarifies our deep-seated fear of monolithic, one-minded systems like communism, religious fundamentalism, zombies and invaders from Mars. Each one is a dark echo of an oceanic state of unifying transcendence from which consciousness must, by nature, flee. The Fall from Grace is, in fact, a Sprint from Grace. Or perhaps more accurately, ""Screw Grace, I am so outta here!""                                                      Questions?"

"Feb 21st, 2011","It was more fun writing these things when I was fairly certain no one was reading them. That is no longer the case. These days it seems like every vanity card is getting scrutinized and criticized by network executives, corporate legal departments and publicity departments, TV journalists and tabloid bloggers. Believe it or not, my musings have been both cheered and jeered by TV Guide! But lately it's gotten out of hand. Which is why I've decided to take a break for a few weeks. Let things cool off a little. Instead of writing short essays that upset people, I've decided to use my one second of network TV to do something simple and hassle-free. Starting with this card, I'm going to display a photograph of a part of my body that is entirely innocuous. No longer will I share some troublesome piece of my mind. Now I will share an actual piece of Chuck that is incapable of offending anyone. You know, a foot, a hand, or maybe a toe. So with that in mind, behold...    my elbow."
"Feb 17th, 2011","Random Things I've Learned in TV Never ask a question when you know the answer is going to be a lie.<br/><br/>Silence is always bad news.  <br/><br/>Strong Nielson ratings guarantee employment, not self-esteem.<br/><br/>Actors can smoke cigarettes because they're immune to carcinogens.   It's safe to talk openly and honestly with people because they're not really listening.<br/><br/>The two major groups in TV show biz are, naturally enough, show people and biz people. Telling them apart is simple. No matter how old they are, 'show' people (usually creative types like writers, actors, directors and musicians) dress like teenagers. Again, regardless of age, 'biz' people  (agents, managers, lawyers, company executives) dress like adults.  When 'biz' people start dressing like 'show' people it means they've made too much money off the backs of the aforementioned 'show' people.  When 'show' people (usually directors) start dressing like 'biz' people, it means they're insecure about their creative involvement and need a hug."

"Feb 7th, 2011","I'm writing this vanity card in Israel. I like it here. Not for the geography, or architecture, or even the history. No, I like it because for the first time in my life I'm surrounded with DNA much like my own. Until I got here, until I wandered around Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, I didn't realize how much my double helix yearned to be around similar strands. Now that's not to say that I don't occasionally have that very same genetic experience in Beverly Hills (particularly in Chinese restaurants on Sunday night). But the sheer homogeneity of Israel overwhelms any over-priced kung pao gathering at Mr. Chow's. The cop, the cab driver, the hotel concierge, the pilot, the waiter, the shoe salesman, the beautiful girl looking right through me as if I didn't exist -- all Jewish! If I had to sum it up, I'd say the sensation is like being at a B'nai B'rith summer camp that is surrounded by millions of crazy bastards who hate the sound of kids playing tetherball, and all the poor little camp has going for it is pluckiness and nukes. Anyway, I have to believe my visceral and very pleasant reaction is some sort of evolutionary, tribal thing. Some sort of survival gene that makes human beings want to stay with their birth group. Which raises the question, why have I spent a lifetime moving away from that group? How did Chaim become Chuck? How did Levine become Lorre? The only answer I come up with is this: When I was a little boy in Hebrew school the rabbis regularly told us that we were the chosen people. That we were God's favorites. Which is all well and good except that I went home, observed my family and, despite my tender age, thought to myself, ""bull$#*!."""
"Feb 3rd, 2011","In the near future, we will see brain scan technology that can determine, without fail, if someone is telling the truth. Shortly thereafter, we will be able to buy mobile devices that perform the same task on the fly. In other words, we are on the verge of having all of our conversations constantly and instantly monitored for veracity. This would then spawn a counter-technology comprised of personal mind shields that keep oneself from being scanned (the use of which would, of course, imply that one is keeping secrets). The end result? Universal honesty, initially as a result of the duress of surveillance, will become the norm. Then, over time, this mode of thinking, communicating and behaving will become second nature. This will usher in the dawn of a new civilization. After thousands of years of human suffering, world peace and the long-fabled 'good will towards all men' will have finally arrived. The end of lying and cheating will also mark the end of scripted entertainment. So, you know, there'll be a downside."
"Jan 20th, 2011","I have a recurring dream that I've been drafted to play on an NBA team. This is a very upsetting dream because I can't really play basketball. I mean, I play pretty much how you'd expect a middle-aged  Jewish comedy writer to play. The words clumsy, hesitant, clueless, short and frightened come to mind. During the dream I'm well aware of my grotesque lack of talent. I run up and down the court hoping the ball doesn't come my way, all the while wondering why the coach doesn't take me out. Even me executing an uncontested lay-up or free throw seems like an impossible, or at least unlikely, event. Assuming dreams work as metaphor and I'm not really subconsciously afraid of having to go mano a mano with Kobe or LeBron, the question I find myself asking is, what in my life do I feel fully engaged in and yet completely unqualified for? The answer is simple: intimate relationships. Once again, the words clumsy, hesitant, clueless, short and frightened come to mind. Well, not short... average."
"Jan 17th, 2011","WARNING! Do not attempt to replicate what you saw in tonight's episode of Two and a Half Men. Despite the seeming lack of serious consequences and regardless of the hilarity that ensued, this is extremely dangerous behavior and could result in injury or death.

"Jan 6th, 2011","The Mask of Undoogoo<br/><br/>Before Undoogoo would venture into the jungle to begin his daily hunt, he would don a mask to confuse his prey. Not a mask meant to frighten. No, Undoogoo's mask was pleasant to look at, designed to trick his quarry into thinking that he was harmless. In this way, Undoogoo was able to get close and strike a lethal blow. Which is exactly what he had in mind the day he spied a beautiful creature drinking at a watering hole. Hiding behind his benign facade, he positioned himself alongside his intended victim and prepared to attack. But what Undoogoo didn't know was that this ""beautiful creature"" was also wearing a mask. A mask that successfully camouflaged a fierce and merciless predator. And so it was that Undoogoo suddenly found himself being devoured, torn apart, eviscerated! His screams echoed through the jungle. But the jungle was accustomed to the sounds of agony, and no one came to his aid. Bloodied and barely alive, he managed to escape and crawl back to his village where, to his horror, he discovered that his tormentor had taken possession of his hut. Now helpless and homeless, he was forced to live the rest of his days in the wild, feeding on what dung beetles feed on. The moral of the story: Mask or not, if you hunt without a prenup, pack some ketchup for the dung."
"Jan 3rd, 2011","If, somewhere in the course of this vanity card, I were to use a monosyllabic, Anglo-Saxon word that sits atop the 'no say' list, my guess is nothing would change in your life. You might form an opinion, have a passing thought, or even choose to be outraged. But, and it's a big but, the choice would be yours. It would not be inflicted on you by the word. The word would be, like Kansas once morosely whined, ""Dust in the Wind."" And yet, we live in a culture that fears the word. In fact, on broadcast television, the phobia for the word has reached the point where the letter f is, in certain instances, no longer acceptable. F has become a subversive letter. According to our network censor, f is often  up to no good. We have been warned. F is being watched! Which brings me to my belabored point. I believe that words bythemselves are actually quite impotent. They hardly rise  above being noise. Ideas, however, the clever, inane and/or insidious grouping together of words, are dangerous. If history proves anything, the wrong idea at the right time  can do unbelievable damage. Bad ideas are what the culture  should fear and guard against. Which is why I get  spooked watching ox News."
"Jan 3rd, 2011","Sometimes I amuse myself by coming up with a weird title and then, working backwards, try to write a little story that fits it.  The following is an example:<br/><br/>A DRINK, A GUN, AND FOUR BULLETS<br/><br/>When I walked into the bar I was already drunk, ergo I was in a bad mood.  When I came to in intensive care the nurse was kind enough to tell me that I must've pissed off a lot of people in that bar. When I raised a puzzled eyebrow she went on to explain that I'd been stabbed five times... with four different knives. She thought that was amusing.  I failed to see the humor.  Thanks to the ""Jesus loves you"" qualities of morphine, I failed to see much of anything for several days.  When I finally left the hospital, minus a few feet of intestines and a gallbladder that was never more than a mystery to me, I was determined to straighten out my life.  But first I needed to get a drink, a gun, and four bullets."

So naturally, he was  madly in love with her. His friends and family began a betting  pool as to how long the relationship would last. The smart money  was around six months, but one wager, placed by his mother, put  the 'over and under' at twenty years. When asked why she saw the  relationship lasting, she said, ""When he was a little boy, I  didn't like his neediness, his lying, his whining, his  unwillingness to go to sleep, his dirty fingernails, his farting  to amuse himself, his finger constantly jammed up his nose, his  poor grades, his filthy room, his idiot friends, his missing the  toilet, his fascination with his penis, and finally, and most importantly, his similarity to his father."""
"Dec 6th, 2010","I keep reading that my vanity cards are rants. This troubles me. To my understanding, a rant is an explosive diatribe, a poorly articulated spewing of raw emotion. To successfully write a rant one would need to use a lot of foul language and a small army of exclamation points. Any casual reading of my cards would, I believe, suggest quite the opposite. I have always steered clear from hyperbolic venting, preferring to make my case in subtle, understated ways. In fact, if any one word were to be used to describe my weekly missives, I think it would be ""stealthy."" Or perhaps ""subversive."" If I were to use two words, I might go with ""winkingly clever."" But ""rant""? I hardly think so. Even the regrettable card from several years ago in which I suggested that many TV critics would gladly eat a hole through their loved ones in order to tunnel toward a real job in show business, was more a humorous observation than an outpouring of vitriol. And my frequent aggravation toward CBS censorship? Please. That's just a little game we play. Funny jokes are killed off by corporate executives in dead-end jobs and lawyers who are unwilling or unable to actually practice the law, while I make a show of complaining. Theater of the Absurd perhaps, but not a rant. To experience the real thing I would suggest watching video of major league baseball managers disputing calls by umpires, or Fox News. Now those are rants. In the meantime, I will continue to calmly offer my opinion regarding the world as I see it, right here after Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and  Mike&Molly. If, for some reason, my detractors find that unacceptable, I will not stoop to using ugly words and exclamation points. Winkingly clever requires inference. <br/><br/>Go inference yourself."
"Nov 22nd, 2010","I believe that there are two forces struggling to dominate this  country. Reinvention and nostalgia. The first seeks to imagine  and work toward a better future by changing the status quo. The  second insists that things were better in the past and works to  undo change. Oddly, the opposing forces have come to be  represented by colors. Blue and red. It's no secret where my  sympathies lie. I've always been a big fan of reinvention. My life  is a testament to it. There is simply no way that a scared,  sickly, vaguely educated kid from Long Island gets to live the  life he's living now without being willing to scrap old,  unworkable ideas and start over (Of course it helped that I didn't  have a rosy past to feel nostalgic towards). Which brings me to  the point of this vanity card. I'm confused by people who seek to  return to a life that wasn't that great to begin with. Oh, I get  it if you used to be the ruling class. If your childhood memories  include watching your granddaddy sip a mimosa on the veranda while  being serviced by the upstairs maid, then sure, nostalgia makes  sense. But, if you're like me and didn't know anyone who had a  veranda, let alone a maid, let alone an upstairs, then why not  consider reinvention? Maybe we can make this country a better  place to live. It's certainly a more exciting way to go. You  know, an uncertain future, filled with mystery and adventure. Of  course, if nostalgia wins the day, if we are to attempt to reverse  the course of history, then I will do my best to cooperate --  starting with bangin' me some household help.* <br/><br/>*Relax, Celia.

Your fault, my fault, no  one's fault. The only way to relieve the torment is to get up,  empty the bladder, drink the coffee, read the paper, run the  treadmill, perform the animal sacrifice, paint the chicken blood  on the groin and call upon the demonic spirits to bring you back.     Nights are bad too. Once again, exhaustion makes the mind  vulnerable to obsessing over woulda, shoulda, coulda.

"Nov 15th, 2010","I believe I have identified a debilitating psychological syndrome that has infected a large number of people, myself included. Simply put, the sufferer, in varying degrees of intensity, is convinced that he or she is ""not alive enough."" This delusion drives them to carry out all manner of self-destructive acts in a vain attempt to ""feel more alive."" I've dubbed the syndrome Peggy Lee Disease (in honor of her classic song which first identified the malady, ""Is That All There Is?""). The list of misguided actions caused by PLD is almost endless; over-eating, over-sexing, over-shopping, extreme sports, sadism, masochism, alcoholism, drug addiction, workaholism and spending all your money to run for governor of California (for a more complete list check web sites such as TMZ and Radar Online). To date, the only sure cure for PLD is altruism -- putting aside selfish interests and giving unto others. I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm waiting for something better."
"Nov 11th, 2010","When I'm not working on The Big Bang Theory, I work on other TV  shows. One of those shows gets a lot of bad press. Sometimes,  when I read the very unkind things written about that show, I'll  remember the words of a sleazy music manager I was briefly  associated with back in my rock 'n' roll days. The guy was right  out of central casting. Bald, middle-aged, pot-bellied and  sucking on a cheap cigar, he would sit behind his metal desk in  his ratty little office and pontificate to dumbass musicians  hungry for career guidance. One of his speeches has remained  vivid in my memory for thirty-five years. He said, to a soon-to-  be-nonexistent, dumbass power trio I was then a part of, ""Boyz, if  halfs da peoples loves ya, and halfs da peoples hates ya, you're a  star!"" At the time I had no idea what he was talking about. It  wasn't until fifteen years later when I was writing for a TV show  called Roseanne that I figured it out. I was once again reminded  of all this when the star of the show I was talking about earlier  came out for a curtain call in front of a packed studio audience.  They went wild with applause. I looked at the man taking the bow  and thought, ""there is a big star."" Then I looked up at the  screaming, cheering audience and thought, ""there are halfs da  peoples."""
"Nov 8th, 2010","Did You Know?    Mental images can stimulate the human brain with the same power as  events that are actually occurring. If this were not the case we  could not argue with long dead relatives or masturbate. <br/><br/>In Bob Dylan's classic song ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" the title  character is urged to ""play a song for me.""  The extreme  difficulty one might face trying to play a song on a tambourine is  never dealt with. <br/><br/>The greeting ""Hey, how are you?"" is a popular method of saying  hello. The person using it is not really interested in your  current state of being. A way to punish them for this deception,  and ensure it never happens again, is to answer, ""Not so good, I  just had an accident in my pants.

"Nov 4th, 2010","Following Kaley Cuoco's horseback riding injury, I've instituted  new rules governing acceptable leisure activities for the cast of  The Big Bang Theory.  <br/><br/>1. No friggin' horses. This includes those found on merry-go-rounds  and in front of supermarkets.  <br/><br/>2. The only motorcycle you can get on is the one you're  accidentally crushing in your big-ass, air-bagged SUV.  <br/><br/>3.

Wild and carefree dancing that celebrates your  incredible and well-deserved success is only allowed on New Year's  Eve, and only with a sober celebrity parasitic flunky to lean on.           6. And finally, sexual acts must be performed while horizontal.   Certain high-risk Kama Sutra positions might be allowed, but only  after consultation with Chuck Lorre. Like with dancing, a spotter  might be required."
"Nov 1st, 2010","Schadenfreude    <br/><br/>    The New York Times recently reported that The Parents Television  Council was in trouble. Just to catch you up, the PTC is a non-  profit watchdog group charged with sanitizing American television.   I'm more than a little proud of the fact that they've spent years  trying to blunt the success of Two and a Half Men (as if we  weren't capable of doing our own blunting). Currently, their  number one priority is organizing advertiser boycotts of a  profanely titled CBS series starring William Shatner. But  according to the Times article, the PTC has not only lost much of  their clout with federal regulators and advertisers, they are also  battling allegations of extortion and fraudulent fund-raising  activities (i.e. using donated money for purposes other than the  ones promised). Which brings me to schadenfreude. The lilting  German word that describes the feeling of pleasure one gets from  the misfortune of others (leave it to the Germans to coin a word  for that). At the risk of coming off as petty, vindictive or  heaven forbid, Germanic, I have to admit to feeling a wave of  schadenfreude when I read the article. The sensation was almost as  good as the warm feeling I get whenever a pro-family politician is  caught on his knees in an airport bathroom. Again, this may be a  measure of my own flawed character, but every time I read the  article (once with my morning coffee, once on the toilet and twice  for this vanity card), I felt an odd sense of reassurance. The  number one rule of human behavior might be ""do unto others as you  would have them do unto you."" But the number two rule is ""people  who try to exert moral authority tend to be hypocritical $#*!  heads."""
"Oct 28th, 2010","Zen and the Art of Sitcom <br/><br/>I have been writing sitcoms for twenty-five years. During this  time, I have learned a few things.  Practical things. Do's and  don't's if you will. For instance, do hire actors based on talent  not looks. Somewhere between take eight and take fifteen, you  will be hating both yourself and the gorgeous, but clueless  ingenue who got the job because she looks exactly like what you  imagined the character looks like... or worse, like the kind of  woman you could live happily ever after with. Don't waste time  with a marginal joke that forces the actor to twist him or herself  into a pretzel in order to make funny. It's much better to work a  little harder and write a great joke that the actor can do in  their sleep. This also allows the actor to be well-rested when it  comes time to renegotiate his or her contract. Do try to be kind  to the power players. The movers and shakers. The people who  tell you how to do your job.  After they fail in network TV, they  will remember you fondly while they're busy tanking fledgling  internet companies. But perhaps more important than do's and  don't's is learning to trust in the mysterious power of intuition.   The soft inner voice that guides you to a better outcome than  experience and logic could ever provide. This is what I call the  Zen of Sitcom. The willingness to allow transcendence to play a  part in the making of a TV show. Try it sometime in your own job.  It can be the source of great inspiration.  A word of warning  though: it's not foolproof.  If your business collapses or you  wind up getting fired, you're probably hearing the same voice I  listened to when I created Grace Under Fire, Cybill and four or  five TV pilots that now function as landfill. If it's possible,  try not to listen to that one.  As inner voices go, it's kind of a  douche."

"Oct 18th, 2010","I have to assume that there's an evolutionary advantage to having  a brain which keenly remembers the bourbon-soaked magic carpet  ride, but not its puke-on-the-shoes, please-God-help-me-find-my-  car aftermath.  The same holds true for romantic relationships.   The dreamy, eye-gazing moment of transcendent intimacy is recalled  with perfect clarity, while the sleepless nights on a bed with  enough room between the two of you to park a car is but a dim  memory.  My theory for this mental preference is that the brain is  hard-wired to push the organism toward pleasure and away from  pain.  It's actually designed to cherish the good times and  discard the bad.  I can't think of another explanation for why I'm  always amused by the ""drink responsibly"" tag at the end of alcohol  commercials.  Sure.  What other way to drink is there?

"Oct 14th, 2010","300. An auspicious card. To me. At the very least it represents my having had a hand in writing and producing three hundred  episodes of television. Some of which were pretty good. Some of  which were... in color. Additionally, it means that on three  hundred separate occasions I tried to turn my one second of  network time into a form of entertainment. Or, if you prefer, a  form of inflammation. Some of the vanity cards were, like the TV  shows preceding them, pretty good. Others were... grammatically  correct. But still. 300.

"Sep 20th, 2010","When I was a child I was taught the saying, ""Sticks and stones may  break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" At the time, I saw  the sense of it. Words, being intangible, have no ability to  inflict physical harm. Whenever another child said something mean  to me, I would loudly recite the saying at them, using it like a  magical incantation that would protect me from getting my feelings  hurt. I usually said it with tears running down my cheeks. As an  adult I've come to see that the saying is, like many things taught  to children, a lie. The truth is that bones heal, while the  damage done by words can last a lifetime. I bring it up here only  to remind those who write about television of the power they  wield. And that is the power to wound with words. The power to be  mean. They have absolutely no power to affect ratings and the  likely success or failure of a TV show. In that arena they are  laughably impotent.  Unengorged.  Limp.  Flaccid, if you will.   Forever poking, but never really penetrating. But I should tread  carefully here.

"May 24th, 2010","Over the years, CBS executives have always been very generous when it comes to sharing their ideas as to how I might better do my job. I have never returned the favor regarding how they might run their network. Until now. Now I have a really good idea. Step One: Create an internal division with workers who do nothing but check out the claims of prospective advertisers. And I mean really check them out. If it's a car, have somebody drive it around to see if it accelerates into walls or slow-moving pedestrians for no particular reason. If it's beer, have someone drink it and report back if it gets them laid. If it's a pill, have someone take it for awhile, then wait to see if they grow a tail, get anal leakage, or commit suicide. Step Two: Quality control. All commercials must be aesthetically pleasing, seriously funny, poignant, or dramatic. Any commercials deemed loud, stupid and/or obnoxious are not aired. Period. No exceptions. Step Three: Tell the world that CBS only airs the coolest and most honest commercials. It's always Superbowl Sunday at CBS! Step Four: Watch the money roll in. A Final Thought: Don't worry about the initial loss of income created by dropping the dumb stuff (e.g. Cockney lizards who sell insurance). You'll more than make that money back by demanding that your high-quality advertisers cut you in for a piece of their action. You have, after all, earned it by giving them the CBS seal of approval. Another Final Thought: If you adopt my idea, my consulting fee is one million shares of CBS stock. Or better yet, one hundred shares of Apple stock."

This was my first trip to Asia and the cliché ""sea of humanity"" was never far from my mind (at times it was so much in my consciousness, it crowded out other clichés like, ""never kiss a prostitute on the mouth."") Anyway, there are a lot of people there. And one day, while walking through a crowded marketplace, I found myself thinking that every one of these people has a story. Each individual in this endless, teeming throng has experienced joy, heartache, success, failure, fury, and despair. They've all struggled with love, money, work, family, friends, illness and death. Just like the actual sea contains an endless array of living organisms, this ""sea of humanity"" contains an infinite number of unique, poignant, hilarious and tragic stories. Which is when I realized that my purpose in life, my true calling, is to be a fisher of stories. And all I need for bait is simple curiosity.

According to Wikipedia, one of its major exports is cattle by-products. Which begs the question, what horrible shape are the cattle in, if all they're good for is felt hats and wallpaper paste?

The characters are named Sheldon, Leo, Hovard, Raj and Natasha, and the show is entitled, The Theorists. Each episode begins with a rapid-fire montage of images which takes us from the dawn of time to the present moment. Keeping with that theme, the montage is scored with what is probably the worst piece of recorded pop music since the dawn of time. And finally, each episode appears to be a Russian translation of a Big Bang Theory episode. When we brought this to the attention of the Warner Brothers legal department, we were told that it's next to impossible to sue for copyright infringement in Belarus because the TV production company that is ripping us off is owned and operated by the government of Belarus.

Without thinking, I said, ""God bless you.""   He gave me a withering look and said, as if to a child, ""Golly gee, I sure hope he does.""  The other guests exploded with laughter, while I imploded with humiliation.  To avoid future embarrassment, what is the correct response when an atheist sneezes? Troubled with ahchoo  <br/><br/> Dear Troubled, First, a little background information. Saying ""God bless you"" following a sneeze is thought by some to have originated in the sixth century in order to protect the sneezer from falling ill to the bubonic plague.  Another possible origin is that people once believed that the devil entered the body during a sneeze and saying ""God bless you"" could help ward him off.  Since the plague has killed something like two hundred million people and the words ""God bless you"" have, in all likelihood, been said countless times to Glenn Beck, we can safely assume the phrase has no real power against germs or demonic possession.  What it does contain is simple human courtesy -- a means by which we express concern for one another.  As to how to respond to a sneezing atheist, well, that's easy.  Simply say, ""Sounds like you're coming down with something, I hope you don't die and rot in a box."""

But now with my new word, couples engaged in that most intimate of human activities can look into one another's eyes (assuming they're facing one another) and whisper the simple, all-encapsulating phrase, ""I fuv you.""

And the natives.... the natives are hungry for meat. American meat. Specifically, ground chuck. What was I thinking coming here for my Xmas break? What insanity led me to this godforsaken hell?! Oh, how I wish I were back in Burbank. Oh, Burbank, Burbank, Burbank! Forgive me for not seeing your beauty when you thrust it in my face. But now that matters not. Or, that matters not now. Either way, my time is running short. Funny how your perspective changes when the end is near. Being overlooked by the Golden Globes, yet again, seems so unimportant to me now. The fact that one of the natives about to eat me is a freelance show biz reporter for the Kota Kinabalu Daily Bugle and a voting member of the Hollywood Foreign Press even provides me with some comfort. For as I close my eyes on this world I'll at least know that while I may not be to everyone's taste as television, if sauteed with butter and lemon, I will be to everyone's taste as lunch."

I have no idea what it means, other than the obvious, and I don't know anyone named Jillian.  Regardless, I thought it'd be interesting to begin a vanity card with it and just see where it goes.  <br/><br/> Jillian had a urinary tract infection... again.  Her doctor liked to abbreviate the condition to UTI.  She liked to abbreviate it to TMH - Too Much Humping.   Regardless, the road back to vaginal happiness was always the same: cranberry juice and abstinence.  Thankfully, her boyfriend, Dudley, was always very understanding.  He'd just smile, hold her in his arms and say, ""Well, babe, when one door closes, another one opens up.""  She'd always giggle and blush when he'd say that, but deep down she wished she had the courage to cover his mouth and nose with a chloroform-soaked rag, and then, while he was unconscious, snip off his testicles with the little scissors she uses to groom her schnauzer. <br/><br/> All of which explains why the next sentence popped into my head recently.<br/><br/> Nobody sang Bee Gees songs on karaoke night like Dudley."
"Nov 23rd, 2009","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #269       <br/><br/>    I have long believed that part of our problem with resolving race issues in America is our inability to accurately name what we are.   Aside from the occasional Johnny and Edgar Winter, there are no white people.  Any child with a box of crayons can tell you that white people are, in fact, beige. The sickly ones are gray. Following this crayon logic, one can easily see that there are really no black people.  They are brown. Or perhaps raw umber. Or maybe burnt sienna.  Frankly, every time I hear someone comment on America's first black president, I can't help thinking, ""No, he's not. He's more like caramel.""  Which is why I think we should all get in the habit of calling each other what we really are.  How can you racially slur a man by calling him ""beigey"" or ""umber?""  The answer is you can't.  Because that's exactly what he is.  The melanin doesn't lie.  Buy a box of Crayolas and see for yourself. We are all members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  Can I hear a kumbaya?"

During the coming attractions I managed to get a piece of popcorn down the wrong pipe.  I started coughing.  People nearby glanced at me nervously.  Then, as the movie was about to begin, I got a tickle in my nose and sneezed.  Twice.  The young couple sitting to my left immediately got up and moved across the aisle.   The old lady directly in front of me leapt to her feet and literally vaulted over her husband in order to sit further away from me.  For some reason, I was a little miffed.  But then I realized the newfound power I had.  I got up, crossed closer to the old lady and young couple and coughed again.  They all glared at me and once again moved their seats.   The game was on!  Maneuvering like a knight on a chess board, I countered their move by moving two rows down and one seat over.  I looked at them.  I smiled.   I coughed.  They were stunned.  How could this be happening?  How had their simple movie outing turned into an Edgar Allan Poe short story?  But it had!  In a matter of minutes, they had become Prince Prospero and his noble cohorts, while I, I had become the Red Death!   The old woman covered her mouth and nose with her hand and cried out, ""Why are you doing this to us?!"" I laughed and said, ""Why?  You want to know why?  Because death, my dear woman, is the inevitable end for us all! And there is no hiding from it. Even at the AMC!""  A horrible silence hung over the theater, no one moved, no one breathed.  Then the movie started and we all settled down to enjoy the whacky, 3-D antics of Jim Carrey.  Oh, and I'm hoping to go out with the nice lady again, but she has not returned my calls."

How do you figure? ME:  Glad you asked. Since the concept of past and future is entirely man-made (ask any other living creature about past and future and all you'll get is a dumb, non-comprehending stare), then it follows that if there is a god, a unifying spirit of the universe, be it ""intelligent"" or simply a pervasively unifying quantum particle sort of deal, then the present, ""the constantly unfolding now,"" is the only possible place it can exist.  Which brings me to my bold assertion: If you laughed at any time during tonight's show, you had to be paying attention. If you were paying attention it means you were, for that moment, in ""the now"" -- the same place as the previously mentioned pervasive, unifying quantum particle we, as a species, enjoy worshipping and committing genocide over.  Ergo, you had a spiritual experience. YOU: Assuming you're right, so what? ME:  So what?!  This is huge!

"Oct 12th, 2009","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #262     <br/><br/> As best as I can tell, life is intolerable. Oh, not always of course. A case can be made for all the big wonders and little blessings and blah, blah, blah. But when you really boil it down, our entire existence rests on a few really ugly premises. First, life, and by that I mean the big life, life with a capital L, must ingest other life in order for it to remain life. Or, put another way, in order to witness the miracle of creation, we must continually eat, and then poop out, a little bit of that miracle. Second, one of the charming side effects of sentient life is emotional pain. The fact that dead and fermenting plant life creates alcohol - a terrific anesthetic for emotional pain - might cause one to think that this is, by nature, a compassionate universe. Think again. Keep dulling that pain with booze and you wind up, if you're lucky, in a church basement sharing your tears with complete strangers. If you're not lucky, you wind up on a waiting list for a motorcyclist's liver. And finally, there is the ever-present knowledge of death. In order to ""more fully appreciate the gift of life,"" we all get to ponder a violently sudden or slow and agonizingly painful descent into oblivion -- after which our beloved bodies turn into the stuff of nightmares. Which brings me back to my original premise: life is intolerable. But rather than go gently into that creepy night, I've decided to start a petition to protest the fundamental conditions of existence. I know it's not much, but it's a start. And damnit, I'm just the guy to do it! The petition is available at chucklorre.com.

I mean, sure, I wish he were better looking... and like five inches taller. I really do hate that he's so short.  Stubby legs on a guy are such a turn-off. Yech. But on the plus side he makes real good money and always buys me nice stuff. And I don't even mind that he's kind of a clean freak.  His apartment is spotless -- like a hospital surgery room.  Oh, and right after sex he has to run and take a hot shower.  Then he makes me take one too. That's a little weird. But nobody's perfect right?  Anyway, from now on I'm gonna be a better girlfriend.  No more fooling around behind his back -- unless the dude is really cute... and tall.  Hee-hee!""<br/><br/><br/><br/> And this is from Andy Mindenhauser, also from Davenport, Iowa.<br/><br/><br/><br/>""I love Regina so much that sometimes, when we have dirty sex and she gets all sweaty on me, I'm pretty okay with it.  Well, for a few minutes anyway, then I have to go wash up.  But now I find out from following her that she is having dirty sex with a man who plays basketball at the park.  This made me very angry.  This was like an ugly stain on a white carpet.  A stain that has to be scrubbed and scrubbed until the carpet is clean again.  Tonight I will scrub the stain from Regina.  I will clean her nice and thorough.  After tonight she will never get dirty again and I will love her forever.""<br/><br/><br/><br/>See?  Isn't that more fun than my thoughts?

"Oct 5th, 2009","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #259     <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Sometimes I have heated arguments with people who are not physically present.  The content of these arguments usually involve me explaining to them how and why they are wrong.  I generally make my case with such passion and logic that they have no choice but to admit to being foolish and weak.  The fact that some of these people are dead does not interfere with me mentally correcting them.  Recently I had one of these arguments while driving alone in my car.  After making a particularly cogent point to a flawed family member in need of my wisdom and guidance, I noticed that I was being watched by an attractive woman in a nearby vehicle.  Desperate to make a better impression, I quickly picked up my cell phone and continued talking as if I were on an urgent business call.  I glanced at her, smiled and shrugged like a man whose work was never done.  A policeman then pulled me over for using my cell phone while driving.  I tried telling him that I was not actually talking on the phone, but was merely using it as a prop, so as to not appear insane.  He smiled, nodded as if he understood, and then made me blow into a breathalyzer.  I passed with flying colors.  After he wrote me a ticket for using a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle, I drove away and had a loud and intense argument with him in which he laughed at my predicament and apologized for doubting me."

Oh, how he strutted and preened outside the little hut where all the chickens lived.  From the corner of his eye he could see them nervously peeking out to see the new cock of the walk.  You could hardly blame him for smiling so smugly. He knew that from that moment on, if a chicken wanted extra feed, well, she had to ask Carl.  Same thing for pecking privileges in the yard.  And of course, when it came time to lay eggs, the premium spots nearest the warming lamps were handed out by you-know-who.  Yep, life was good for ol' Carl. Up at dawn, a loud clearing of the throat, a largely ceremonial patrol of the perimeter, and then, an afternoon and evening of doling out favors to the chickens.  And the best part about it was he never had to actually ask for anything in return.  He would simply tell each chicken to decide for herself what, if anything, she should give him to ensure his continued friendship.  But let me tell you, it's no accident he named his rooster hut ""Casa Quid Pro Quo.""  Yep, Carl had it knocked.  At least until he was forced out of his job by a class-action paternity suit that was entirely without merit and probably politically motivated by bitter, eggless chickens."
"Sep 28th, 2009","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #257     <br/><br/> OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY<br/><br/> I was born in a women's prison in Mississippi. My mother was serving a life sentence for shooting her boyfriend's roommate.  According to court documents, her defense was,  ""I was aiming at my boyfriend.""   My father was a prison guard who would later in life write and illustrate a children's book about a rooster who enjoyed the attention of many chickens.  The book was short-listed for a Newbery Award.  I was taken from the prison and sent to live with my maternal grandparents who eked out a meager living selling bathtub thalidomide to circus folk.  My early years were uneventful except for being forced to stay up way past my bed time in order to  ""keep an eye out for angry circus folk.""  Desperately unhappy as a teenager, I was sent to a therapist who determined that I was possessed by deeply disturbed spiritual beings that had been imprisoned in a volcano billions of years ago and then blasted with hydrogen bombs by an evil alien warlord.  After the twisted spirits were successfully purged from my body, my depression magically vanished, only to be replaced by self-loathing, arrogance and ulcerative colitis.  This, of course, provided a natural segue into my current life as a twice-divorced sitcom writer.  As a footnote, one of the tormented beings pulled from my body went on to unsuccessfully run NBC for several years."

"May 11th, 2009","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #252        <br/><br/><br/><br/>The following is an excerpt from my keynote speech at the 2009 SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY WRITERS OF AMERICA NEBULA AWARDS.<br/><br/> When I was 12 years old, my teenage sister had a boyfriend whom my parents lovingly named ""Cross-Eyed Larry.""  In my official capacity as the ""obnoxious little brother,"" I took it upon myself to annoy and harass poor Larry at every opportunity.  In fact, I specifically learned to cross my eyes so I could welcome him to our home with the appropriately juvenile comedic flair. (My mother constantly warned me that if I didn't stop doing that my eyes would stay crossed.  In hindsight it appears as if she was lying or, at best, misinformed.)  Anyway, my speech tonight is a long overdue attempt to make amends for my childish pestering and cruelty towards this polite young man whose only discernible character flaw was a poorly-aimed libido (no way he was getting over on my sister).  But even more than an amends, I needed to find some way to thank him. And here's why: way back in 1964, Larry did something that would change my life forever. In order to get rid of me so he could stick his tongue down my sister's throat, Larry gave me a dog-eared copy of Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles.  His plan worked brilliantly.  The book not only turned my prepubescent, Hardy Boys world upside down, it would begin my lifelong love affair with science fiction.  Unfortunately, Cross-Eyed Larry was not so lucky. Ultimately rejected by my sister, he descended into a life of drugs and crime that ended tragically when he was murdered in Attica State Prison because another inmate thought he was looking at him funny."

"Apr 27th, 2009","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #250       <br/><br/> For months I've woken up to a mysterious, intermittent banging sound coming from somewhere in my home.  I can't tell you how many mornings I groggily walked around in my pajamas searching for its cause.  Frustrated by my inability to locate the source of the banging, I falsely accused my ancient refrigerator and began seeking a replacement. But then I caught a break.  Rising early one morning for reasons urinary, I stumbled across the real source of the strange noise -- a small, yellow-breasted bird living in a tree next to the kitchen window.  Periodically, he would fly to the window, furiously peck at it with his beak, then quickly retreat to a nearby branch.  At first I assumed that the morning light caused him to see his reflection and, being of limited intelligence, or filled with self-loathing, attack it. But once again, my initial instinct proved to be wrong.  After a long conversation with the bird, I learned that he was banging on the window because he had it in for my refrigerator. I have since apologized to the fridge, but it has been, not surprisingly, cool towards me. <br/><br/> Sorry, that really wasn't worth the journey."

"Mar 30th, 2009","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #248       <br/><br/> I believe that Newton's first law of motion is the reason we will emerge from our current economic woes.  That law states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.  How does that relate to the financial #$%*storm we're now cowering under?  Allow me to explain. There are slightly less than seven billion people on this planet.  Assuming that roughly half that number are either too young, too old, too lazy, or too loaded to work, that still leaves almost three and a half billion people getting up in the morning to chase the almighty dollar, the transcendent rupee, the zen yen,the dear ol' euro, the what's goin' on yuan, the... well, you get the idea. Now, call me crazy (and many have called me far worse), but I happen to think that three and a half billion motivated people is one big damn object in motion.  And the only thing acting against that object is the friction caused by a small bunch of greedy, dumbass, screw-the-pooch, Ivy League pot stickers (the unbalanced force).  I therefore assert that the unbalanced force (you know who you are, shame on you), will eventually be overwhelmed by the object in motion (three and a half billion people with pluck, aka pluckers), thus allowing the object in motion to continue its relentless journey forward, thriving and conniving until it is once again slowed down by other unbalanced forces, or a very large meteorite.

The huddled confabs, the whispered asides, the sideways glances, the roll of the eyes, the smirks of disdain, the sulking pouts, the exhalations of disgust, the looks of admiration (few and far between), and the endless variations of body language that reveal impatience, rejection, jealousy, and simple disbelief that I'm in charge and you're not. I see it all.  And I don't comment.  I just make note of it.  Occasionally I will respond in a roundabout fashion that might make you think I'm clairvoyant.  I am not.  I am simply watching.  Just thought you might like to know. <br/><br/> Carry on."
"Feb 9th, 2009","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #240       <br/><br/> A wise man once told me that we are all God in drag.   I like that.  Sometimes when I'm in a public place or sitting at a stop light, I'll watch people walking by and I'll silently say to myself, ""He's God.  She's God.  He's God.  She's God.""  Before long I always find myself feeling a warm sense of affinity for these strangers.  The experience is even more powerful when I do this while observing a person who is clearly suffering.  On occasion I'll test my little spiritual practice by turning on Fox News.  Within minutes I become an atheist."

"Jan 19th, 2009","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #238        In 1970 I enrolled at the State University of New York at Potsdam under my given name, Charles (Chuck) Levine.  I lasted two years.  Most of my memories are of playing guitar in rock bands at bars and frat parties (Casey Jones, Whipping Post, Southern Man, Aqualung), trying desperately to get coeds to wrap their legs around my 27 inch waist, learning to juggle, playing frisbee, Zig-Zag rolling papers, repeatedly listening to Voodoo Chile, and playing acid chicken with my roommates (the game involved who could watch their face melt in a mirror the longest without suffering a full-blown psychotic break).  Oddly, I have only two memories of actually being in class.  One in which my pupils were inordinately dilated and the professor was rude enough to notice, and the second when the alcoholic bastard who taught creative writing mocked my work and informed me I'd never make it as a writer because my grammar was awful. I only bring this up because someone at my old alma mata figured out I was once Chuck Levine, contacted me and offered me an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree along with an invitation to speak at this year's commencement ceremony. Thrilled and proud to finally have a college degree, I immediately accepted.  In fact, I have already begun writing a speech which I hope will prove inspiring to the fresh-faced graduates. The theme is ""personal reinvention, or how I stumbled ass-backwards into a job where grammar was ignored and neurosis, fear, desperation, childhood wounds and mediocrity was richly rewarded."" I've also started practicing throwing a tassled hat up in the air using my old, wickedly accurate, frisbee wrist flick."
"Jan 19th, 2009","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #237           There's a funny moment in tonight's episode where Sheldon gets stuck on a rock-climbing wall and remarks, ""What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote don't you understand?""  I thought it'd be helpful to take a moment and examine that joke.  A linear asymptote is essentially a straight line to which a graphed curve moves closer and closer but does not reach.  In other words, given a function y=fn(x) with asymptote A, A represents a number that, no matter how big (or, given the function, small) you make x, y will never make it to A. The particular example Sheldon quotes is the inverse Tangent function, or Arctangent, which has two asymptotes.  If you graph it, it sort of looks like a horizontal S:  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how big you make x (that is, how far you move to the right), the function is never going to hit that top line (π/2), and no matter how small x gets (moving to the left), y is never going to be smaller than - π/2.<br/><br/> The more you know, the funnier it gets."

Every trade ad and mailing begins with the words, ""For your consideration.""  It's kind of a Hollywood tradition.  Anyway, this is what I've considered so far: Milk (a well-meaning gay guy is shot to death by a homophobe), Doubt (A really mean nun accuses a really terrific priest of being a pedophile), Revolutionary Road (a married couple fight a lot, cheat on each other, then the wife bleeds to death following a botched abortion), Slumdog Millionaire (incredibly poor kids subjected to unthinkable evil, but with a happy ending), Defiance (starving Jews fight Nazis in the woods),  The Wrestler (a broken-down, over-the-hill wrestler on steroids has a tough life), Changeling (a woman's son is abducted and the police put her in an insane asylum), Gran Torino (a dying widower commits suicide to help his neighbor), Benjamin Button (a guy grows old in reverse and then dies), Rachel Getting Married (a drug addict kills her baby brother and then pisses off her family during a wedding), and The Reader (Nazi atrocities, under-age sex and illiteracy prove to be a lethal combo).

"Dec 15th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #233    <br/><br/>   Recently the magazine Entertainment Weekly had an article entitled the ""The 25 Smartest People in Television.""   Yours truly was ranked at number twenty.  If the article is to be taken seriously, and God knows, why wouldn't any sensible person take it seriously, that means there are currently nineteen people in the TV biz who are smarter than me.  Now I'm just thinking out loud here, but if something were to happen to those nineteen people... if say, they were to, one by one, have horrible accidents, or mysteriously disappear, then that would make me, ipso facto, the number one smartest person in television.  Then I'd just have to keep an eye on number twenty-one. Christina Wayne, Senior VP of original programming at AMC, looks like the kind of woman who would stop at nothing to move up a spot."
"Dec 15th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #234    <br/><br/>   In tonight's episode, the great James Earl Jones delivers Charlie's eulogy during Charlie's imagined funeral.

But, as you'll see below, the sub-audible eulogy still managed to become a tale worth telling.  <br/><br/> JAMES EARL JONES<br/><br/>I'd like to take this moment to read one of Charlie's favorite parables.  A story which I'm told gave him strength and inspiration during trying times. ""Dear Penthouse Forum -- I always thought your letters were made up until this happened to me.  I was stranded at O'Hare Airport one rainy night when two stewardesses from Lufthansa Airlines noticed the bulge in my carry-on bag.  The bulge was actually nothing more than a Monte Cristo sandwich I brought with me in case I got a bit peckish.  But homeland security being what it is these days, they requested that I step into a utility closet for a quick pat down and cavity search.  The two stews, both named Greta, took turns *#@!&% me like a wild stallion.  First it was me and Greta, then it was me and Greta, then it was me, Greta and Greta.

"Dec 8th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #232    <br/><br/>   The classic song New York, New York  contains the following stanza:<br/><br/> If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere It's up to you - New York, New York.<br/><br/> The implications of the lyric are clear -- if one has the personal qualities to overcome the formidable obstacles presented by New York City, then one is guaranteed success in less imposing places. Having ""made it"" in Los Angeles, this troubles me.  Is my success forever tainted with an asterisk?  Even more upsetting, are there certain zip codes where my talents would most likely fall short?  Am I doomed to fail as a sitcom writer in Dripping Springs, Arkansas?  Or Mud Hole, Florida?  Hell, what are my chances of  getting a primetime show in Dry Prong, Louisiana?  Having not initially succeeded in New York, the answer, of course, is slim and none.  <br/><br/> All of which is a long way of explaining why, whenever I hear New York, New York, I have no choice but to mentally replace the lyrics with words more suited to my experience.

Inferno and flood.  Soon the stinging smoke, raging wildfires and inevitable pyromaniacs will give way to months and months of biblical rain.  And with that rain will come the memories... a home perched on a hilltop becoming garbage nestled in a valley, an idiot falling into the L.A. River and trying unsuccessfully to crawl up its cement banks, another genius being lifted off the roof of his car by a helicopter in Encino, the cliffs above Pacific Coast Highway collapsing yet again and causing Malibu residents so much inconvenience, Bob Myer reassuring me that writing the second act of a Roseanne episode at two in the morning is more in my self-interest than trying to drive home and move my stuff to the second floor (but more likely becoming one of the knuckleheads standing on the roof of his car praying for a chopper).  But I, as is my nature, whataya gonna do, I yam what I yam, digress.  Eventually the rains will stop, the underbrush will grow, the drought will come, the drought will linger -- maybe for years, until the mountains and hillsides once again explode with ""Live At Five"", ""Film at Eleven"" hellfire, and thus continue the cycle of seasons of Southern California... if you don't count earthquakes and riots.  And strikes.  And award season.  No insurance policy protects against the damage done by award season.  Oops, I digressed again."

"Nov 17th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #228    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>We were recently slammed by something called the Parents Television Council.  Rather than protest, I wrote a vanity card thanking them for the plug and sent them a box of fancy cupcakes.  They promptly responded with a cute thank you letter suggesting that I might've poisoned the cupcakes.  The letter went on to explain how they planned to employ one of their young interns as a food taster. If he did not die from eating one of my cupcakes, the rest of the PTC staff would happily dig in. If he did die, they would happily hire an attorney, sue me and become wealthy. Cute, right?  But then I got to thinking, this is an organization that exists solely to protect the youth of America from entertainment they find objectionable. And yet their immediate response to a box of cupcakes - albeit in joke form - was to sacrifice a young member of their team. Say what you will about the comic content on Two and a Half Men, when suspicious food arrives at our offices we would never dream of asking a young intern to test it.  We'd ask an old writer. And only because the body of an aging comedy writer is capable of ingesting poison and turning it into TV."

But while the gods of tech, medicine, guns and money give us the illusion of being safe, they don't give our lives meaning. For that we need other gods. And who are these other gods?

But instead of saying ""fine,"" which was how he answered that question every other day, he paused and considered the days' events, and all the events that had led him to this point in his life.  Then he crossed to the hall closet, took down a shoe box from the hat shelf, removed a small caliber pistol that he'd bought for home protection, and immediately blew his brains out all over the badly framed photograph of him rowing Barry Manilow.

Add to that the billions of years and infinite forces essential to creating the conditions needed for human beings to exist, cut down the tree, haul it to a mill, carve it into smaller pieces, send it to a chair factory, shape it into a chair, ship it to a store, purchase it, stick it in an SUV and drive it home so that an equally complex ass can sit on it, and you begin to know a chair.

That being said, if, by subtle words or actions, you can make a man feel sexually viable, he will act like a fool and you can steal his job.

"May 12th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #210           <br/><br/>I believe that in order to walk through grief, fear, loneliness, despair, confusion and anger without recourse to drugs, alcohol, over-eating, over-sexing, or the endless mind-numbing distractions provided by Western culture, one must become a spiritual warrior. I further believe that the pay-off for enduring suffering, for soberly embracing the inevitable bouts of emotional pain that life brings, is wisdom and serenity in the face of calamity.  But make no mistake here, the path of the warrior is treacherous and cannot be walked alone. To survive, he must have brothers and sisters-in-arms to carry him when he buckles.  When we lived and died in small tribes, this principle of mutually supporting one another through the trials of life was deeply woven into the fabric of the group mind. With the advent of towns and cities we were forced to  live with the daily dilemma of being desperately alone and yet desperately needing one another. Which is why we are, by design, always seeking new tribes.  With that in mind, I humbly offer a simple guideline to evaluate the efficacy of any tribe you might encounter on your path to becoming a spiritual warrior: if they ask for your money or access to your crotch, run away.  If they ask for your money, smile unceasingly, never blink, and guarantee to make you a demi-god, running away will not suffice. Change your mailing address and briefly reconsider drugs, alcohol, food, sex and TV."
"May 12th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #211           <br/><br/>When I began writing these vanity cards, I never in my wildest dreams imagined that one day they would be the subject of an extensive article in The Wall Street Journal (or as I like to call it, The Depressingly Inevitable Next Step Toward the End of a Free Press in America, Thanks a Lot Rupert, Journal). But I digress into a bitter diatribe on the profit-fueled degradation of journalism that spells the end of any hope for rational debate in this country from my initial point -- which is, gratitude for all the attention my cards are receiving. I mean, let's face it, a vanity card, by definition, is merely an exercise in personal vanity.  The truly legitimate production card at the end of each episode belongs to the Warner Brothers Corporation.  They're the monolithic, multi-tiered, entirely un-integrated, boy-did-we-make-a-colossal-boo-boo-with-AOL entity which owns the facility we shoot in, deficit-finances production, distributes the shows around the world, and most importantly, maintains the shaky book-keeping necessary to hide the profits while blowing a fortune on Speed Racer.  But once again, I digress. I should also add that I am aware and deeply appreciative of the blogging that goes on around my cards.  I do occasionally lurk at various web sites to see what folks are saying. I enjoy the discourse while  simultaneously feeling a deep, nagging fear that any of these people might someday learn my home address."

"May 5th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #209           REFLECTIONS ON AN EXPERIMENT, from the writers of ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"":Never underestimate the value of feeling stupid.  Year after year, you toil away in your own little corner of the world -- decapitating, eviscerating, electrocuting, suffocating, occasionally squishing Ð- and pretty soon, you've got it all down pat.  You use phrases like ""subdural hematoma"" in casual conversation and laugh when someone mistakes the color of urine fluorescing under an ALS for that of blood.  And then one day, for reasons which can only be explained by some form of mass chemical imbalance, you and several other maniacs decide that it would be fun to rip yourselves from your wombs and visit a very different world, one in which all the arcane knowledge and craft you've carefully accumulated over the course of a career is suddenly and utterly worthless.  A world where the only rule is whether or not it makes you laugh, where actors say exactly what's on the page so it better be funny right down to the syllable, and where puns are the lowest form of humor.  And as you grapple with your fundamental inability to do any of these things particularly well, you realize that you have so much more to learn.  And that's a good thing to be reminded of, at least from time to time.So thank you, Chuck, and Lee, and everybody else at ""Two & A Half Men"" for making us all feel stupid.We look forward to returning the favor this Thursday night at 9."
"Apr 28th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #206           <br/><br/>I think we can all agree that the cliche, ""no pain, no gain,"" is a fundamental truth.  When we experience physical pain in the gym, we gain muscles and stamina.  When we endure hardship and sacrifice in order to succeed, we gain a feeling of satisfaction and achievement, not to mention financial rewards. When we truly embrace emotional pain, we gain compassion for the suffering of others, an appreciation for the fleeting nature of things, as well as wisdom and spiritual humility. Every act of birth is an act of pain.  Our very lives are sustained by the suffering and death of plants and animals, who in turn are sustained by other organisms having a very bad day.  That being said, I think we can also agree that this system sucks and needs to be seriously re-jiggered.  Now I'm not saying I have a better approach than this pain/gain thing that's been in place for millions of years -- but that doesn't mean we couldn't start tossing around some ideas.  For instance, why couldn't an infrastructure for life be developed around the theme, ""no dream, no gain?""  Sounds like heaven, right?  Or is dreaming too easy? Would life quickly become complacent and cease to gain?  But then, is gain really that critical? Or is gain the whole point?  Is the fact that life exists at all proof that God or the universe hates complacency? It certainly explains why aboriginal people are constantly being murdered for the sake of ""progress.""  It even explains why HBO went down the toilet."
"Apr 28th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #207           <br/><br/>Hey, Chuck, what do all those TV writing credits mean? <br/><br/> I'm glad you asked. The first credit you see on the screen is story editor. It's worth noting that story editors don't edit stories. Their main job is to exist in a constant state of paranoia about being fired because no one sees how brilliant they are. An executive story editor is a story editor with a cool-sounding word added to their title. In order to qualify as a story editor, one must have spent some time as a lowly staff writer. Interestingly, staff writer is the only writing credit that actually has the word ""writer"" in it. It is also the only credit that does not appear on the screen. I'm told that this curious lack of acknowledgement was devised by The Writers' Guild. The writing credit above story editor is co-producer. No aspect of the show is produced by the co-producer. Next up we have producer. Again, nothing about the show is produced by a producer, but if they aren't fired they're pretty much guaranteed becoming a supervising producer. One would think there'd be some supervision or producing at this level. One would be wrong. Climb the ladder another rung and you reach co-executive producer. This is usually a talented writer who has endured years of emotional punishment for creative input, an office with a window, infertility and/or premature baldness. Then there is the consulting producer.  Consulting producers are usually former executive producers who are willing to work for less than their usual fee but don't want anyone to find out. Finally, at the top of the TV food chain, is the executive producer.  The executive producer is either the creator/head writer who will die of a massive heart attack trying  to supervise every aspect of production, a co-executive producer who was conned into dropping the ""co"" from their title in lieu of money, the star, the star's boyfriend, the star's manager, or a former network executive who fell ass backwards into a pot of gold."

"Apr 14th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #202           <br/><br/>Tonight's story about Sheldon's ego being crushed following his encounter with a young prodigy has its roots in my own life.  Around 1974 I was playing guitar for a living in Miami Beach.  I was twenty-two years old and thought I was really something.  In the parlance of musicians, I felt I had some ""serious chops.""  Nights I played clubs, hotels, and private parties. For a few months I worked in a lounge band on a cruise ship. I even landed a day gig playing acoustic solo stuff at a coffee house in South Beach. That was where a professor from the University of Miami saw me play, dug what I was doing, and invited me to audit his jazz guitar class at the university.  I happily accepted, thinking I might be able to teach the kids a thing or two.  I still remember the first class, me sitting in the back proudly holding my beat-up '64 Fender Strat, while the college students all cradled expensive Gibsons.  Of course, this only made me feel more smug.  I was a working musician.  These were rich kids in a rich school with instruments that daddy bought 'em. But then something happened that would change my life forever.  A painfully shy, sixteen year old boy walked into the room.  He could barely speak nor make eye contact with anyone, seemed dwarfed by his big jazz guitar, and was ludicrously introduced as a visiting professor to the university. His name was Pat Metheny.  I'll never forget how I felt when he began to play.  It was an imploding feeling, like the kind you get when your ego is being demolished like an old Vegas casino.  Thankfully, the feeling was accompanied by a soft, reassuring voice in my head that whispered, ""Find work in television, nobody's a prodigy there.""  Thirteen years later I listened to that voice (I may have been deluded, but I was no quitter).  Oh, and Pat, if you happen to read this... thank you."

"Mar 31st, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #200            <br/><br/>Two hundred vanity cards.  I have now amassed a body of work that can safely be called ""pointlessly unique.""  In the history of literary efforts, there has never been a literary effort quite like this one.  Okay, literary might be pushing it, but I don't think I'm engaging in hyperbole when I say that it's highly unlikely my achievement will ever be duplicated, let alone surpassed.  Why?  Well, most show creators who are awarded the hallowed, second-and-a-half, end-of-episode ""hey everybody, look at me!"" card, have better things to do.  Those that have no life (a goodly number), are simply not compelled to vomit up weekly offerings of painfully personal, petty, mock-metaphysical, self-congratulatory, rage-filled, and regretfully sarcastic essays that occasionally haunt them forever. Sure, non-showrunners can write a weekly essay of no particular value.  But for it to be considered a true vanity card, it must be attached to the ass end of a television show.  And let's keep in mind I've made a lot more shows than vanity cards.  There were many weeks on Dharma & Greg and Two and a Half Men when I was too wasted (mostly in the literary sense) to write something coherent.  Anyway, I wanted to use this momentous card to celebrate my accomplishment because, well...  no one else was jumping up to do it.  Two hundred cards! Boy, oh boy, that is really something... Oh God, I'm so lonely."
"Mar 24th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #199            <br/><br/>Tonight's episode was about Charlie being drugged and imprisoned by his stalker, Rose.  In addition, we did jokes about nasal spray being an effective aid for love-making, a young boy's desire to go to a strip bar, a mother cavalierly assuming that her son has some sort of third-world venereal disease, a Korean woman suffocating from the toxic fumes she inhales painting the toe nails of a ""white she-bitch,"" stalking the British Royal Family, a woman holding a man's penis while he urinates, two men being interrupted while defecating, suppositories as a barbiturate delivery system, and finally, a hooker used to purposely transmit a viral infection. But the joke that we could not put in the show tonight, the one comic moment that CBS Broadcast Standards absolutely refused to bend on, was a harmless bit of word play which required the mention of a name-brand hard liquor.  When I asked why, I was told it's against CBS corporate policy.  I desperately wanted a drink."

If you would like to read my latest exercise in poor judgement, I'm sure you can find it somewhere on that thing we writers were striking to claim dominion over.  Just to be on the safe side, I apologize in advance.  Please know that my aim was only to provoke a bit of gaiety through the judicious use of a little thing I like to call ""the truth.""

"Mar 17th, 2008","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #197          <br/><br/>About a year ago I received a phone call from a mid-level CBS exec who began the conversation by saying he wanted to give me a head's up.  Having been in this business a while I knew that ""head's up"" is code for, ""we've decided to screw you, but didn't want you to hear about it from your agent... or urologist.""  In this case the head's up was that CBS was going to stream several episodes of Two and a Half Men on their web site. When I asked how they intended to pay the writers, actors and directors of those episodes, I was told that the streaming was considered ""promotional,"" therefore no residuals would be forthcoming. (He didn't really use the word ""forthcoming,"" I just think it's better story-telling if the bad guy is articulate.) I took a moment to let his words sink in, to let the moment play out, if you will. Then, for no reason whatsoever, I switched to a phony southern accent and asked, ""Is there paid advertisin' on that ol' internet site you fellas are runnin'?""  The exec was completely thrown off-balance by the utterly surreal quality of my good ol' boy act and blurted out, ""Yes! I'm sorry! I know it's wrong, don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger!"" (Actually, all he said was ""yes,"" but once again I think good story-telling demands a panicked confession from the running dog of evil corporate bullies.)  Anyhoo, this was the first time I knew a brutal strike was coming -- if you don't count the day, four and a half years ago, when I sat in Patric Verrone's backyard and listened to him lay out his plan to bring justice and fair play to show business."

"Oct 29th, 2007","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #191<br/><br/> I'm writing this vanity card at six o'clock in the morning on October 18, 2007. It's my birthday. I am fifty-five years old. I have long ago become invisible to young women.  They actually do not see me.  But I am not writing this to complain.  I am at peace with my circumstances.   The blessing of fifty-five is a libido in decline.  The curse of it is that major pharmaceutical companies are successfully exploiting my insecurities. Suddenly that surreal commercial of a silver-haired guy sitting naked in an outdoor bath tub and holding hands with a naked, slightly younger woman in an adjacent tub makes perfect sense (if I had produced that spot I would've have given him a small plasma screen TV so he could watch ESPN during his hang time).  I'm also mesmerized by the commercial featuring middle-aged men gleefully celebrating their ability to drink water and drive long distances (I particularly enjoy that the slightly younger women in that one are turned on knowing that their geezers don't have to urinate frequently).

It's taken me ten months to get in touch with my feelings about that article (pretty quick for a guy), and guess what?  I'm angry!  How dare anyone suggest I have no right to feel what I feel?  If you're even barely engaged in this world, anger manifests itself constantly (assuming you're not medicated, which I am not, dammit to hell!).  And let's be totally honest here, anger does a lot of good.  It clenches my stomach muscles into a tight knot so I can look good with my shirt tucked  in.  It adds hours and hours of productivity by keeping me awake until five o'clock in the morning. It's a constant reminder that I should never own a gun.  It makes golf an opportunity to practice my javelin toss.  It fills me with joy every time Lewis Black is on The Daily Show.  It adds sizzle to caffeine. It whispers to me that I'm fine, that I don't need to slow down, and that my cardiologist is an idiot. It keeps people at a healthy distance during flu season (and the rest of the year as well). And finally, it encourages me to use my vanity card to foolishly burn bridges with TV critics.  Hey EW!  Do not screw with me. I've got two vanity cards now, and I'm not afraid to use 'em!

Imagine that rhyming pattern with Chuck and then imagine living through the sixth grade.  Later in life I grinned and beared my way through a seemingly endless series of movies about a killer doll named Chucky.  Oh, what joy I felt when friends would gleefully point out billboards announcing the sequels, The Bride of Chucky and The Seed of Chucky.  And now, there is a spate of film and television projects that have brilliantly re-discovered the humorous use of my name.  Beginning with I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, followed by Good Luck Chuck, then a TV series entitled, get ready to laugh, Chuck, a Kelsey Grammer sitcom in which he plays a guy named, get ready to spit milk up through your nose, Chuck Darling, and Pushing Daisies, a supernatural thing which features a pretty female lead named, because it's so damned, freaking funny, Chuck. And if that weren't enough, I recently received a gift of a John Varvatos designer t-shirt inexplicably emblazoned with the phrase Chuck is God.  All of which is why I am respectfully requesting a moratorium on the comedic use of my name.  I know we're too far down the cultural road to go back to using ""Bob,"" but I'm sure if we put our heads together we can find some suitably funny alternatives.  I know it can be done.

I could see her as she slowly descended beneath the window frame. I could see him too. He just stood there smiling, like the canary who got eaten by the cat. But then a funny thing happened while I was dancing the voyeuristic bebop in my terribly trendy, bright-green plastic shoes. I found myself thinking that the aching loneliness I was feeling had its roots in something much deeper than being eighty-sixed to a one bedroom efficiency in the marina by a dame who digs deep into the degrading bang-bang in order to make up for an emotionally distant father. No, this was the pain of existential separateness.  The false sense that one is fundamentally apart from people, things, life, the whole damn universe.  In a blinding flash I realized that what I was really experiencing was the result of a life-long indoctrination by a culture which elevates individualism above all else, thus causing a soul-crushing sense of aloneness which demands over and under the counter medication, the constant distraction of sporting events, TV, major motion pictures and a pop-tabloid religion based on celebrity worship/crucifixion.

"Sep 24th, 2007","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #182   <br/><br/><br/><br/>Back when I was writing and producing Dharma and Greg, the only way to read my cards was to record each episode on a VCR and hit the ""pause"" button.  This was not an easy task.  The image wobbled like crazy making the tiny words of my weekly tomes very hard to see.  Then it hit me.  What about building a device that records video images digitally?  Wouldn't this allow for a much more precise ""pause"" function?  I took my little notion to an impoverished computer whiz by the name of Schlomo Tivowitz.  At the time of our meeting Schlomo was feverishly trying to invent an  improved version of the George Foreman Grill. Schlomo's grill would contain a hard drive that remembered all the details of your last barbecue, as well as an address book. I didn't really see the point of it, but, not being a tech guy, I held my tongue and presented him with my idea.  I will never forget his reaction.  With hamburger-flecked spittle flying from his blubbery lips, he laughed, called me some very unkind names and demanded that I leave his mother's basement immediately.  My hopes dashed, I went back to work on Dharma and forgot about my silly idea.  Well, I'm sure you can figure out what happened next.  The fact that you're reading this card right now should tell you.  Thankfully, it's not in my nature to be bitter. But there are times when I feel a little used -- usually when I've forgotten how to effectively grill a fatty piece of chicken."

"May 7th, 2007","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #180   <br/><br/><br/><br/>I love golf. I find it to be a terrific workshop for dealing with the everyday problems of life. The problem that most comes up for me in golf is fear. Fear of looking foolish, fear of choking, fear of scoring badly, fear of scoring well, fear of letting down a playing partner, fear of hitting it in the water, the sand, the street, the snack bar, the woods, dead left, dead right, two feet in front of me, or into the soft head of an innocent child at play. Fear causes my mind to race and my muscles to tighten. The swing that follows causes my opponents to smirk and count my money. Golf teaches me that I cannot suppress the fear, nor think my way out of it. My only option is to acknowledge it and swing anyway. This is a lesson that I have tried to apply to my work. Every day I make a conscious effort to gracefully accept my fear of being judged as inadequate, my fear of letting down people who count on me, my fear that I have nothing of consequence to write about, my fear that no one will watch the show because they'd rather watch mediocre celebrities dance, my fear regarding the welfare of my children, my fear that my sister will never talk to me again, my fear that I will die alone, my fear that the mole on my leg is melanoma, my fear that aneurysms happen without warning, my fear of global warming, bird flu, random violence and dirty bombs -- and work anyway. The result has been astonishing. I believe my work is better than ever. I have also tried to apply this golf lesson about fear to my dealings with women. No luck so far. I think I need to swing slower and keep my head down."

The scene, as I'm sure you remember, involved Charlie finding Alan, post-coital, tied to his bed, and wearing nothing but a bustier and red nylons. The offending line in the scene was what we in the comedy biz refer to as a ""callback"" since it references a line that was said earlier in the episode (in this case two lines, the first being when Alan's date implies that she hopes to spend the night with him by coyly saying ""I brought a toothbrush with me,"" and the second, when Alan tells Charlie that ""that lady in there brought a toothbrush with her because I have a penis and a job!""). Now before I tell you the joke which was cut, it's important to point out that I'm not doing this to make a point about censorship. In this particular case we never felt unfairly edited. The excised joke was, without question, in terrible taste and we didn't even try to defend it. But we did think it was funny. In any case, here it is: In the original, uncensored final scene, Charlie nonchalantly exits the bedroom without untying his hapless brother. Alan reacts with astonishment and calls out, ""Charlie?... Charlie?! This isn't funny! Come back!... At least take out the toothbrush!"" When we shot this version our studio audience laughed loud and long. Our CBS censor's head exploded, injuring several writers standing nearby."

"May 15th, 2006","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #159   <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> A Scientific Theory for Male Promiscuity<br/><br/> For obvious evolutionary reasons, strange causes a chemical to be released in the brain that makes a man feel good. He is thus driven to seek out strange. Unfortunately, this euphoric brain excretion quickly becomes ineffective because strange is only strange once (although with alcohol and some creativity, its strangeness can be lengthened, sometimes for several years). Nevertheless, eventually strange ceases to be strange, which forces the brain, designed over millions of years to avoid pain and locate pleasure, to find new strange. Scientists disagree as to when this simple evolutionary mechanism created the mutation known as divorce lawyers, or why the entire concept is not accepted by the formerly strange as a good reason for sleeping with her sister."

Tonight's show, for instance, was inspired by many of the great films that have been out recently. Two handsome young cowboys share a hidden love that society condemns. A love that torments them and presumably requires a lot of lubrication. A brilliant homosexual author is not tormented about being homosexual but drinks a lot and is tormented while writing a book about tormented men who have killed people. A brilliant and tormented country singer is tormented until he stops drinking and finds the love of a good woman who is not tormented. A brilliant TV news man is tormented by his moral obligation to stand up against a tormented bully. A spy is tormented by the corruption and deceit that lies beneath the politics of oil (a lubricant). A cross-section of Los Angelenos are tormented by the endless cycle of racism that lies beneath the surface of Los Angeles. An Israeli soldier is tormented by the endless cycle of violence that lies above the surface of the Middle East. And finally, a big monkey is tormented because he loves a really small woman, who, if their love were to proceed, no amount of lubricant would help. Now, if you go back and review tonight's episode you'll see that both Charlie and Alan were tormented. See how it works? The lubrication stuff we're saving for sweeps."

Becoming rich. Becoming a famous musician, actor, writer, director or artist. Becoming a famous athlete. Becoming a brooding loser who is also handsome. Becoming funny. Becoming thin. Becoming old. Becoming apathetic. Becoming a woman. Becoming a college professor. Becoming a religious leader. Becoming psychotic (this allows one to achieve the steely confidence bestowed by alcohol, but without the attendant liver damage). Having really big muscles and hanging around simple women. Having drugs and hanging around women who are addicted to them. Having food and hanging around hungry women.

In order for this vanity card to air on Monday, October 24th, it has to be written and turned in by ten o'clock. I have nothing. No theme, no jokes, no philosophy. The clock is ticking. It's a digital clock, so not really. I suppose the blinking colon between the hour and the minutes is a sort of ticking. I pause for a moment to determine whether there's any value in writing about mechanical versus digital clocks, then decide there isn't. The pressure builds. I pause again to drink a protein shake that my wife insists is good for me. Once again I stop to consider if there's something comedic to be mined here. Maybe a fantasy card about how she's trying to poison me. No. She reads these things, probably not wise to give her any ideas. I keep thinking how this is just like my entire academic career.

The middle of something is equidistant from the beginning and the end. A new term has to be coined for people my age. Five-eighth man is accurate but not likely to catch on. When people say I look young for my age what they really mean is, ""you're not fat and you have hair."" When I see guys my age who are fat and bald I feel happy. My ears and nose are getting bigger. Gravity is defeating my testicles. My waist is on a collision course with my chest. Sleeping is becoming more important than sex. I am now capable of injuring my shoulder by brushing my teeth. I no longer exude testosterone. If anything, I exude Crestor and Tums. When beautiful young women look at me, they instinctively know, on a deep genetic, cellular level, that I can buy them a house. I do sit-ups anyway. I've begun to resent young men and find reassurance in the knowledge that most of them can't go around buying houses for young women. I no longer fear that I'm becoming more and more like my parents. I now fear that I'm going to stay like them."

A battle between the forces of darkness and the forces of light, between those who seek chaos and those who cherish and defend order. Many brave and good men have taken on this eternal struggle, but there is only one who has never bent, never hesitated to do what needs to be done. He is a rough, violent man who risks his own soul so that the rest of us may safely live out our lives in ignorant bliss. He seeks no credit. There are no medals, nor parades for men such as he. He fights for us and then, weary and bloodied, he returns to a life of simple anonymity, writing and producing a sitcom for CBS. Who is this soldier? His name does not matter. But you can be sure of one thing, he wouldn't mind a freaking Emmy nomination once in awhile. And he could probably hit evil people on the head with a Golden Globe."

"May 16th, 2005","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #137  <br/><br/> I believe that there is an unspoken contract between those who purport to make comedy and those who watch comedy. That contract states that in exchange for the viewer's time and attention, he or she will experience the simple joy of laughter. Anything less constitutes a breach of contract. We've worked very hard to hold up our end of the bargain. We hope you've laughed. We certainly have. For those of you who have not fully given us your time and attention, we would expect you to do better in the future. Talking to loved ones while the show is on, even if it's to comment on the show, means you're not really holding up your end. Try waiting for the commercials to discuss specific jokes and startling plot developments. Another thing to look out for is eating loud food that gets in the way of hearing all the dialogue (this includes eating in a hurry so your dinner will be fully digested before the folks at CSI Miami start poking at cadavers). Needless to say, all phones must be shut off and toilet visits are allowed only if clothing, furniture and slow-moving pets are threatened. In such cases, viewers are encouraged to leave the bathroom door ajar so they can still hear the show (men are advised to pee on the porcelain part of the bowl to reduce unnecessary ""stream"" noise). If the above demands seem onerous, please keep in mind that we have entered into an unspoken comedy contract. Failure on the part of either party to comply with its terms will result in reality TV."

"Mar 21st, 2005","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #134  <br/><br/> Last night I dreamt that Ellen DeGeneres was inexplicably hot for me. We were at some sort of party where she told her friends that she found me irresistibly sexy and that, despite being a lesbian, she wanted to do me. As for myself, I was torn. I'm a big fan of Ellen's. She's incredibly smart and funny, not to mention cute as the proverbial button and sassy as the equally proverbial all get out. I think my ambivalence stemmed from being confused about why, given her sexual orientation, she would be interested in me. Anyway, as the dream progressed Ellen made advances toward me that were, well... very sensual. My ambivalence did not stop me from doing a little smooching and copping a feel. She has a great body. Very lithe. And that was the end of the dream. Or all I could remember. Ellen, if this vanity card should get to you, please know that your passion for me was a beautiful and natural thing.

"Mar 7th, 2005","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #133  <br/><br/> There was a scene in this episode which was drastically cut down in order to appease the censors. Their problem with it was the length of time we spent on the nude back of an attractive young woman. My problem is knowing that I work in an industry, or perhaps I should say a culture, that is more comfortable showing a dead naked body than a live one. A glimpse at any of the prime-time police procedural shows reveals that the powers that be, both in Hollywood and Washington, are perfectly at ease with graphically detailed autopsy scenes that show female corpses being carved up in order to reveal the titillating (pun intended) cause of death, or, if it's during sweeps, examined for traces of semen. Now I don't for one second believe that this little vanity card vent of mine will accomplish anything. I even strongly doubt that, despite living in a country that espouses ""free speech"", it will even be broadcast. I just needed to get it off my very alive, and very sexual chest. (p.s.

I hope you use them.<br/><br/> doorgasm - The feeling of relief and pleasure when the person you had casual sex with finally goes home. I feigned a bittersweet smile as she walked out of the bedroom, then was rocked by a powerful doorgasm the second I heard her car start.<br/><br/> gridlove - A delusional fantasy that occurs when you glance at the person in the car next to you in a traffic jam and are momentarily convinced that they are the answer to all your hopes and dreams.

While I do not want to diminish anyone's contribution, I do want to take this opportunity to point out who actually participates in the writing of each and every show. In alphabetical order, and in a ridiculously large, propitiative font, they are: Jeff Abugov (quit Cheers to go to My Two Dads), Lee Aronsohn (a sweet-natured, teddy bear of a man without an original tooth in his head), Susan Beavers (her real name), Don Foster (a bodhisattva in a crappy hat), Eddie Gorodetsky (if you don't know him you might not exist), and Mark Roberts (happily married until his wife finds the secret room where he prays to head shots of Mariska Hargitay).

"Jan 17th, 2005","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #128  <br/><br/>THREE UNFINISHED VANITY CARDS<br/><br/> I haven't played guitar professionally in twenty years and I'm still haunted by a recurring dream where I find myself playing in a rock band on an instrument I don't know how to play -- usually drums, tenor saxophone or a Hammond B-3 organ. The organ dreams are the least frightening. I hold down chords for an inordinate amount of time, swoop my hands up and down the keys like Greg Allman and hope no one notices.<br/><br/> I recently told a TV reporter that I need to feel love for my work in order for the quality of the work to rise to a level that has any merit. I surprised myself with this comment. Most of my life my work has been motivated by my fragile, child-like ego. If I do good work, people (okay, women) will like me. Is this a sad, Freudian mommy thing? Probably. It sure attracted a lot of women who were more than happy to mommy me. But that's not what I want to talk about.<br/><br/> The act of writing is often a painful ordeal for me. This got me to thinking; what would happen if I began from a place of simple, unabashed joy? Would the words and ideas flow? Would I be a vessel rather than a forge? A conduit as opposed to a generator? Would the work cease to have a belabored, manipulative quality and become something else? Something better? Something... freer? These questions, and several others which I deleted because they were belabored and manipulative, caused me to look at all the blessings in my life so I could experience a state of joy from which to write. After a little soul-searching I became aware of the grace and bounty which surrounds and sustains me. And then I began to write this vanity card which, I have to say, sucks so badly it staggers the mind."

Having just bought the bodice, this really bummed her out. Still, she wanted more than anything to be devoured by his earthy passion. Unfortunately the idea of saying ""devour me with your earthy passion"" creeped her out, so instead she murmured ""Hum daddy bow-wow."" He had no idea what she was talking about and found himself wondering whether it was positive verbal feedback in regards to his foreplay technique, or signs of early onset dementia. He went with positive feedback because the notion of making love to a woman who would soon be drooling into a cup was not terribly arousing. Not un-doable, but not a big turn on either. Thus resolved, he threw her to the bed, missing high and to the right. Her head careened off the night stand, somehow turning on the clock radio to an easy listening station. Tina Turner was singing ""Proud Mary"", but just the nice and easy part. They paused briefly to check for signs of a concussion. Not knowing what those signs might be they decided to forge ahead and make love as if they'd never made love before, as if it were the first time. And so they did. They made love in a hurry and badly. Afterwards, she wondered how she could have been foolish enough to leave a good job in the city, working for the man every night and day."
"Nov 22nd, 2004","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #125  <br/><br/><br/><br/> I was told earlier this evening that I had to write a vanity card immediately in order for it to make this air date. Lacking inspiration and desperate for a theme, I flipped through my beloved, dog-eared copy of Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke. It was there that I found the following words of wisdom:<br/><br/> ""Go into yourself. Search for the reason that bids you to write; find out whether it is spreading out its roots in the deepest places of your heart, acknowledge to yourself whether you would have to die if it were denied you to write.<br/><br/> Alright, well, it's worth a shot. I'm going into myself... I am searching for the reason that bids me to write... Oop, there it is. It's actually three reasons: a thin veneer of prestige to cover up a lifetime of low self-esteem, enough cash to protect against ever again being bone-crushingly poor, and finally, a good health plan so I never have to crawl into a teaching hospital and get a colonoscopy without an anesthetic while fifteen grinning med students watch. Okay, now that my reasons are clearly located, I'm determining if the roots of those reasons are in the deepest places of my heart... That's a toughie. I've been in TV for too long to still have a heart... I'll just skip ahead to the next question: Would I ""have to die if it were denied me to write?"" Wow, that's pretty heavy... I know I felt that way when I was younger... Oh, wait! This is Letters to a Young Poet. I found a loophole! The hell with writing a vanity card. I'm gonna take a nap."

The downside of our naming procedure is seen in tonight's episode, entitled ""Frankenstein and the Horny Villagers."" The title was taken from dialogue in a scene featuring Charlie and Rose.

"Sep 20th, 2004","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #120   <br/><br/><br/><br/>        There are moments when I feel driven to tear through the sitcom surface of things and expose the rage, fear, greed, envy and lust that quietly fester in the shadows of my being. In order to accommodate these dark, corrosive feelings, I've decided to use my vanity card to begin writing a novel. The book will be a work-in-progress. This means you will often come across passages that will be re-written or simply thrown out. You will also join me in occasional episodes of writer's block and/or lethargy which bring the entire process to a grinding halt. A word of caution, I have never written a book before and fear I'm not up to the task. Of course part of that fear may stem from the fact that as I write these words, I don't know what the book is about. I just know it will have no easy jokes; just the bitter, hurtful truth that is our daily human condition.

"May 24th, 2004","CHUCK LEVINE PRODUCTIONS, #119   <br/><br/><br/><br/>Let me explain. I was born Charles Michael Levine and went by the name Chuck Levine until I was twenty-six years old. The reason I changed my name was simple. My mother, never a fan of my father's family, had an unfortunate habit of using Levine as a stinging insult. When displeased with me, she would often say/shriek, ""You know what you are? You're a Levine! A no good, rotten Levine!"" So, for as far back as I can remember, every time I heard my last name I would experience acute feelings of low self-esteem. Whenever roll was called in school I would sit in quiet dread as the teacher ticked off the L's: ""Labianca, Lepkowitz... Levine -- Arghhh!"" My first wife was the one who suggested I change my name to remedy the situation. In fact, it was she who came up with the name Lorre, complete with the fancy spelling. I thought it sounded great. Chuck Lorre. Charles Michael Lorre. Finally a name that did not make me squirm. It didn't occur to me that in England my new name translated into Chuck Truck. Nor did I realize that the famous actor, Peter Lorre, was mostly famous for playing smarmy, closeted gay guys (not that there's anything wrong with it). But most interestingly, I had completely forgotten that when I was around eight years old my father's business began to fail, forcing my mother to find work in a clothing store called... Lorie's. Pretty creepy, huh? Did I abandon my father's name only to unconsciously name myself after a place associated with my mother's abandonment of me? Or, even creepier, did my ex-wife somehow know all this and propose the name Lorre just to screw with me. Hmmm... I was a no good, rotten husband so I certainly had it coming."
"May 10th, 2004","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #118   <br/><br/><br/><br/>Hi, I'm Lee Aronsohn, co-creator of ""Two and a Half Men"". When Chuck invited me to borrow his card for this one episode, I jumped at the chance. I mean, I've been in the business for over 25 years but I've never had a vanity card. It's not that I lack vanity, it's just that the cards themselves have eluded me. And now that the time has finally come, guess what? I actually can't think of a thing to say. It's like, you wait and wait for something but then when you finally get it you don't know exactly what to do with it. Fear takes over. What if I embarrass myself? I only get one shot. If I blow it, my humiliation will be preserved on videotape and other digital media for decades to come. You know, I was never very good with pressure -- that's why I decided not to go to law school. Well, that and the fact that my grades kind of sucked. But I digress. What I need here is a really profound thought -- something which expresses a unique aspect of my personal philosophy. Okay, how about this: Contrary to conventional wisdom, time is not a dimension. In fact, time does not, in itself, exist. 'Time' is simply the name we give to one aspect of the ever-changing relationship between moving objects in the universe. If nothing moved, there would be no time. Hence, 'time travel' is a meaningless concept and I will never be able to go back and avoid having written for 'Charles In Charge'. Thank you, and good night."
"May 3rd, 2004","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #117   <br/><br/><br/><br/>I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for watching the show. I know that for many of you, particularly those who go to the trouble of reading my vanity cards, a real and continuous effort is being made to support what we're doing. So this is my little attempt at reaching out and saying how truly grateful I am. It's hard to grasp the idea that roughly sixteen million people watch each episode. But, according to the statistics, that is the astonishingly large audience we're getting every week. The fact that much larger audiences turn out to watch derivative, soulless singers being humiliated by a panel of unqualified dildos, or a bunch of pathetic shmucks jumping around like spider monkeys on crank to get a make-believe job with a goofy-haired guy on the brink of bankruptcy, does not lessen my profound gratitude. The fact that a few TV critics, who would probably eat a hole through their loved ones and crawl through if it meant they could get my job, insist on ignoring or denigrating our success, does not diminish my joy. I am a man who knows how to cherish the blessings that have been bestowed on him. And I just wanted to say so."
"Mar 22nd, 2004","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #116   <br/><br/><br/><br/>AN OPEN LETTER TO THE BOARD OF DISNEY<br/><br/> If you are indeed seeking new leadership, I urge you to think outside the box. And what's outside the box? Me. Overlooking for the moment my ill-fated attempt to buy your company outright, I would like you to now consider me as an appropriate choice for CEO. What are my qualifications? Well, to begin with, I own a beautiful Zegna suit and I know where to buy more (this may sound silly but let's face it, half the job is lookin' CEOish). I am in awe of Harvey Weinstein and Steve Jobs and will act like a slavish sycophant in all my dealings with them (at least until I get a deal to write and direct a quirky movie for Miramax about a troubled sitcom writer and a Mac G-5 from Jobs at dealer's cost). While we're on the subject of key corporate relationships, I will also make every effort to get along with Roy for the simple reason that he looks so much like his uncle it's spooky. I think internationally (e.g. I will make a respectful, but action-packed buddy movie about Krishna and Buddha which won't open big in the U.S. but will do boffo box office in parts of the world where there are lots of people). I will be a real team leader and encourage our network execs to make TV shows that don't suck. I will lessen our reliance on minimum wage teenagers dancing around dressed as big-headed, cartoon characters. I'm not a big hockey fan but I'll keep the Ducks going because as a professional comedy writer I understand the importance of the word ""puck"", not to mention the inherent laughs that come with big guys on skates hitting each other with sticks. And finally, to demonstrate my comprehension of corporate synergy, I will immediately commission thrilling new roller-coasters to be built in Anaheim that incorporate elements of two legendary ABC series, Dharma & Greg and Grace Under Fire (I can personally guarantee that the Grace ride will be very scary)."

His all cash offer of five million dollars (in small bills) plus an S500 Mercedes with only 34,000 miles, Braebus rims and a tricked-out sound system, combined with his successful track record of writing, producing and creating hits for ABC (Roseanne, Grace Under Fire, Dharma & Greg) offers the Disney stockholders an opportunity to escape the clutches of cable giant Comcast. Should his offer be accepted, Lorre plans to create a major motion picture based on the ""Teacup"" ride and the ride with the fake hippos in the water. As far as ABC was concerned, Lorre said creating hits for network TV is a very difficult proposition but he doubted that he could do much worse than that ""Are You Hot"" thing. In exchange for rescuing Disney, his only demand was that he be allowed to run the company part-time. His reasoning being that he loves writing and producing Two and a Half Men. He did indicate that he would come in on the weekends to read scripts and approve price increases at the theme parks."

"Feb 2nd, 2004","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #113    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Every so often I'm hit with an overwhelming urge to write.

Thankfully, it has passed.   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp"
"Jan 5th, 2004","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #112     <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>When I was in the shower this morning, I thought: If we assume a Big Bang beginning of the universe, then every molecule, every atom, every proton, every electron, every quark, every wavelength, every vibration, every multi-dimensional string, every everything that makes up everything else shares an ineffable property of pre-Bang Oneness. Assuming that, then every everything is always moving in one of two directions: either away from that primordial state, or returning towards it. We feel these quantum movements. Moving away is experienced as loneliness, fear, anger and despair. Returning is experienced as one or more of the infinite variations and gradations of what we call love. Now, while some might say that equating the miracle of human feelings to the meandering of sub-atomic bric-a-brac robs them of their mystery, the truth is quite the opposite. Connecting our fundamental experience of life to the great mystery of existence ties us to the eternal within our every waking moment. We are not separate. We are made of the same stuff that existed at the beginning and will exist at the end. Therefore, the question we must each ask ourselves is simple: ""In what direction am I moving today - towards oneness, or away from it?"" When I was done reflecting on this, I stepped out of the shower, toweled off, and, while glancing at the mirror, pondered a new thought: ""I have a pretty nice ass for a guy my age."""
"Dec 15th, 2003","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #40 REDUX    The following is an old vanity card that I thought was worth running again. Once upon a time there was a wave. The name of the wave was, no surprise, Dave. Dave the wave. Dave was a big, powerful wave. His massive blue body surged across the surface of the ocean with great majesty and deceptive speed. Oh yes, Dave was quite a wave. From the moment he rose up from the ocean he felt special. He felt invincible. Ferocious storms battered him with wind and rain, great ships sliced through his very heart, and yet he rolled on. It was not for him to stop and consider the other waves. To stop was to die. Waves have to keep moving...or else. But then one day Dave saw a strange darkness on the horizon and, for the first time in his life, felt fear. What could it be? Was it connected to the laughing creature sliding across his face on a piece of wood? But before he could make sense of it all, he crashed down into darkness. For a brief moment he felt a weird, splashing feeling, then oblivion. Dave was no more. He was now a part of the sea. And as we all know, the sea loves to make waves."

A check of the one hundred and ten cards I've already written will quickly demonstrate that I should have written this card a long time ago. Why didn't I? Vanity. I had become vain about my vanity cards. I was determined to write a new one each week because, well... I'm just that kind of guy. But I'm older and wiser now. I know when I have nothing to say.

"Oct 13th, 2003","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #110     <br/><br/><br/><br/>THE DREAM: I'm in a cemetery, attending a funeral. I'm not sure whose it is. My mother, who died a year ago, is there -- alive but not well. We leave the funeral and I take her back to a place I used to live that is now unfurnished and cold. There is no food there. I leave her there anyway. I then find myself shopping in a supermarket while holding a baby swaddled in a blanket. The supermarket is run by young people. They play rock music too loudly for a supermarket and seem to be having a good time. I keep losing the baby, putting it down and forgetting where I put it. I select two items and go to the checkout stand where I'm told that one of the items, some sort of raisin bread, is very expensive. I tell the check-out girl I don't want the raisin bread and then realize I've lost the baby again. Thankfully I find the baby but then decide I can't leave my mother in an empty house. I hurry off to bring her back to where I now live, a comfortable home with all the amenities. MY ANALYSIS: The funeral is for my inauthentic self. The self that's been conditioned by parents, culture and environment to survive by whatever means necessary. It is a frightened, angry thing which I'm just now realizing is not my true identity. My mother played a powerful role in its formation. I take her to a barren place because I have not been able to confront nor integrate her influence into my consciousness. The baby is my authentic self. The essential soul that exists before conditioning. I alone am responsible for that self's well-being and am constantly abandoning it in favor of the illusory comfort of the false self. The supermarket is filled with food, music and youthful energy which symbolizes the wisdom, creativity and vitality which nurtures the soul. There is a high price to pay for these things. It is the price of freedom. I balk at paying that price. Finally, I retrieve my mother and bring her back to the nice house, which means I'm ready to bring her influence in my life up to a conscious level. CONCLUSION: My wakeful thinking is not drenched in metaphor, therefore the dream must have originated from some eternal source of compassionate wisdom, or, I shouldn't read books about Jungian psychology before I go to sleep."

Our characters are flawed, yet smart. The kid is, and will remain, a real kid. There will be no bachelor auctions. No one's getting stranded in a cabin or stuck in an elevator. There will be no dream sequences, talent shows, or fantasies.... at least in the first season. Ditto for homages to ""Rashomon"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and ""A Christmas Carol"". A car horn or other random noise will never be used to cleverly disguise naughty words. We will never have a character enter a scene if it reminds us of Lenny and Squiggy. Pop culture reference jokes are cheap, easy and date the show. We will not do them. There will be no pedantic, socially conscious stories. No matter how poignant the moment, we will never broadcast our studio audience going, ""ahhh"". Similarly, no matter how titillating the moment, we will never broadcast our studio audience going ""wooo!"". If we see 'it' coming we assume you see 'it' coming and we will therefore do our utmost to avoid 'it'. No fat jokes (unless they're really, really funny). The same goes for penis jokes.

Over the next few years my efforts to mend it by creating a new show led to an even deeper emotional nadir when I noticed that I had somehow become the author of a seemingly endless succession of failed pilots and pilot scripts. This was not a big enough string of stinkers to lower AOL-Time Warner's stock price (that had already been done by people more incompetent than myself), but my ill-advised attempts at heart-mending were sufficient enough to cause people in suits to not look up from their cobb salads when I ambled into the WB commissary (in Hollywood even has-beens amble). But I was indomitable. I kept writing... and failing... and ambling. And then, about a year ago, my good friend and favorite cross-to-bear, Lee Aronsohn, told me he needed to write something fairly quickly in order to keep his Writer's Guild health insurance. Everyone -- friends, agents, execs -- told me not to get involved. They assured me that I was too big, too successful, for such a partnership. You see where this is going. Lee and I wrote ""Two and a Half Men."" Which brings me to the glaringly obvious spiritual lesson in all this. How do you mend a broken heart? The Bee Gee's never figured it out, but I did. You help a friend keep their health insurance from lapsing."

I bring this up as a way of reminding myself that I get deeply attached to things I write (in this case co-write) and become fiercely resistant to change, even though I know from experience that every thing I've ever done got better with each successive draft. Taken a step further, perhaps this obsessive drive to protect an early draft is a microcosmic view of the struggle to resist evolution on a macro scale. Perhaps the struggle to resist is an essential part of the process. Perhaps the human race is merely an early draft, a minor blip in an inexorable and endless process of cosmic re-writes.

When I began this vanity card I had what I thought were several sophisticated themes worth delving into. One dealt with the quantum physics discovery that the very act of observing a phenomenon changes the phenomenon. Another explored how I might behave if all my problems were suddenly and mysteriously solved (my contention was that I would obsessively create more problems almost immediately). And still a third premise discussed the always popular ideas of self-love and self-forgiveness. My premise here was that these sorts of concepts are inherently flawed and potentially destructive in that they deal with the individual as something that is split in half: the forgiver and the forgiven, the lover and the beloved. But in the end I managed to abandon all my heady themes the minute I realized the deep personal significance of this card number. I was thirteen years old when ""Get Smart"" debuted in 1965. I thought it was hilarious and had an immediate and massive crush on Agent 99. To further complicate matters, I was tormented by the knowledge that 99 had a crush on 86 (Maxwell Smart). Thankfully, 86 was moronically oblivious to her affections, so I retained a childish hope that one day she would be mine. Needless to say, my love remained unrequited. But it was not in vain. Thirty-seven years later that innocent boyhood crush would bear fruit as vanity card #99."

Of course that saying neglected to mention that throughout my life the one person most likely to fool me would be me, so it too proved to be somewhat limited in its effectiveness. In addition to clever little axioms, Mr. Penzel tried to teach me to think for myself, to have the courage to be unique, to rebel against the status quo. During the height of Beatlemania (and it was most definitely a mania) he mischievously tried to get our class to embrace a ""we hate the Beatles"" attitude. He failed. But let me tell you, asking a bunch of thirteen-year-olds in 1964 to even consider not being part of a youth phenomenon like the Beatles was as iconoclastic as you could get. It's funny, I don't remember what I ate for breakfast yesterday, but I vividly remember Mr. Penzel, short, dark-haired, almost impish, putting up a new ""wise saying"" every Monday on the small bulletin board near the door, directly below the clock.

To feel their love you'd have to assume that there are 'love particles' (or waves) that radiate from person to person. If you believe that then you'd have to believe that movie stars are constantly bombarded by a warm, fuzzy feeling as a result of the worldwide emanations of love flowing toward them. Trust me, they feel bombarded, but not by the warm and the fuzzy. Or try this: When you look at your beloved and feel that special feeling, does your beloved look up from their oatmeal and realize they're the lucky recipient of your love? It is my contention that if they did look up, the only thing they'd realize is that there's a big gob of oatmeal on their pajamas. I would also contend that their only inkling that you love them is when you smile and say, ""Honey, would you like me to make you some oatmeal?"" And that wouldn't actually be feeling love as much as inferring love (she cooked me oatmeal, she smiled at me, my mother cooked me oatmeal, my mother smiled at me, my mother said she loved me, ergo she loves me). My guess is that when you're feeling loved, what you're actually feeling is the love you have for the other person. That's good news, right? If all we ever wanted was to be loved, the key to that love was in our hands the entire time. To feel love, give love. Simple.

They probably want to tell me they don't like it. They'll tell me that because they're power-hungry and if they like it they have no power. Power is derived from not liking it and forcing changes.

Another tried-and-true element of sweeps episodes is what's called stunt casting. This means that inordinate amounts of money are spent to cast big stars as special guests on the show.

"Nov 13th, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #91   <br/><br/><br/><br/>Do you ever feel like you're experiencing a powerful and terrifying shift in your fundamental consciousness? Do you ever have thoughts that horrify you? Oh, dear God, was that me who just thought that evil thought? Do you ever open your eyes in the morning and wonder if you're the same person who went to sleep the night before? Do you ever think, ""Aw, screw it. Why do I even try? What's the point? Everything always goes to hell anyway."" Do you ever wonder if the guy bringing you your soup hates your guts because he has to wait on you and pretend to be pleasant all the while knowing in his heart that he's a better man than you and his current servile status is final proof of an unjust universe? Do you ever think, ""People are only nice to me because they want something?"" Do you ever think, ""I'm only being nice to this person because I want something?"" Well, the reason I bring all this up is to reassure you that I don't. Just thought you'd like to know... although I can't help but feel that you're not particularly happy for me."
"Oct 30th, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #90*   <br/><br/><br/><br/>I wrote what I thought was a particularly clever essay for my ninetieth vanity card. Unfortunately, you can't read it because it did not make it past the censor. Apparently it was considered to be disrespectful towards certain unnamed people I dubbed ""corporate overlords."" Upon re-reading it I can understand how one might view it that way. I guess I was hoping that those in power would simply laugh at my juvenile irreverence and that would be the end of it. ""Oh, that Chuck! What a wild and iconoclastic sense of humor he has!"" (In my in imagination when they speak about me all their sentences end with exclamations because just the thought of me excites them.) Anyway, the premise of my now dead essay was that I wielded immense leverage as a result of a large, devoted, cult-like group of vanity card readers who could, when sent into action by me, positively influence the ratings of D & G. This personal leverage could then be used to force the unnamed power brokers to negotiate with me ""on my terms."" The big funny of the essay was that I had no idea what ""my terms"" might be. I visualized a scenario wherein I sat in a boardroom eating deli sandwiches with important people who ""trembled"" at my ability to command vast legions of TV viewers through my vanity cards. Hopefully when my time here on Earth has drawn to an end, the original draft of number ninety will be discovered and cherished by generations as yet unborn. But until that day, this card will have to do. Number ninety with an asterisk. Unless of course this card gets axed because it too fails to meet broadcast standards. Okay, let me quickly mention that ""corporate overlords"" is what we in the TV business say when referring to people with big hearts and even bigger senses of humor."
"Oct 23rd, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #89   <br/><br/><br/><br/>I don't know about you, but my fundamental character flaws are so deeply embedded in my consciousness, it actually feels as if they're entwined with the strands of my DNA. Lately I like to imagine that as a child I was a sort of brand new, meat-based computer that had an operating system installed with big, whopping design problems. The result is that when my scanning mechanisms bring in data from my environment, I invariably process that data in ways that do not reflect reality. Example: I walk into a room that contains people. They are speaking amongst themselves and laughing. My immediate computational response is summed up by a voice in my head which says, ""They're laughing at me. Why are they laughing at me? I hate them."" Or: I see, hear or read about someone who has achieved great success in my field. My organic computer processes this info and spits out, ""Danger! Danger! Survival is threatened!"" Are these fundamental character flaws? You betcha! Taken to an extreme this sort of thinking can cause a lot of suffering -- and not just to me. In my rare moments of mental and emotional clarity I've come to realize that this is an unavoidable part of who I am. The trick now is to overcome or at least soften my flaws before I'm sent back to the factory as damaged goods. Example: When I wrongly think I'm the center of the universe and my problems take precedence over the problems of others, I pause and say to myself, ""Error. You are useless, ugly and unworthy of being loved."" At which point I say, ""Why should I listen to you? A broken computer can't repair a broken computer."" At which point I put myself into sleep mode before the whole system crashes."
"Oct 16th, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #88   <br/><br/>Perhaps it's part of our basic nature to drift into a waking dream state when there are no serious threats on the horizon. Perhaps that's why the universe is constructed as a dangerous universe -- to keep us awake. Maybe God felt it was redundant for the creatures inside his/her/its dream to be dreaming as well. If that's the case, the plan is working, my dream is over. In this dream, I lived in an invulnerable fortress, safe from the misery, ignorance, jealousy, hatred and chaos that surrounded it. I dreamt that the minutiae of my life was important. I dreamt that I could make my little plans. I dreamt that everyone was essentially playing by the same rules. And finally, I dreamt that my dream was reality. Which is why I feel a strange tinge of gratitude bubbling under my grief, fear and rage. I'm grateful to be even a little awake. The way I figure it, this is a miraculous universe, but also a remarkably dangerous one. Sleepwalking is ill-advised."
"Oct 9th, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #87     (The following should've been vanity card #86. Sorry.)<br/><br/>I was nothin' but angry, lost and on the run, 'til I stumbled and hit my knees, under the California sun.

She laughed and showed me, the deepest mystery, the numbers of heaven. One and one is three. One and one is three. One and one is three.<br/><br/> One thing about angels, they ain't always right, we had a little baby girl, made from San Francisco light. We called her Dharma, 'cause the truth was plain to see, the miracle of life, one and one is three. One and one is three. One and one is three."
"Oct 2nd, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #86    <br/><br/> Depression. Sadness. Grief. The blues. Self-pity. Melancholy. Regret. Remorse. Low. Broken-hearted. Down-trodden. Morose. These are but a few of the words that come to mind when trying to describe my mood as of late. Now before you call a suicide prevention number on my behalf, please know that I am aware that the condition these words describe will pass. The problem as I see it is not the condition but the feeling implied by my gloomy list of words (I can't believe I forgot to put 'gloomy' on the list). The feeling is so bad that my tendency in the past has been to feel anger whenever sadness threatened, for the simple reason that sadness feels worse than anger. Anger at least can flow outwards. Sadness flows in. On the other hand, anger generates road rage and getting your head caved in by a guy in a pickup truck with a tire iron, while sadness inspires you to watch unbelievably bad TV to distract you from feeling sadness. And, of course, both sadness and anger stem from fear -- fear of losing what you have or fear of not getting what you want. And fear stems from the tightly-held belief that what you have and/or want is even remotely important. To be fearless is to be free from desire -- even desire for one's own life. Don't get me wrong, I'm not even close to that consciousness. Heck, as soon as I finish this vanity card I'll probably go watch the Oxygen Channel."
"Sep 25th, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #85    <br/><br/><br/><br/>This is my fourth attempt at writing this vanity card. My first attempt was a not-very-witty ""welcome back"" sort of thing. You know the type. I've done them at the start of earlier D&G seasons and thought it might again bear fruit. Needless to say, fruit was not borne. I then tried my hand at a cute little essay on workaholism and its psychic roots in my painfully juvenile demand for admiration. I think we can all agree that no more need be said about that (actually quite a bit can be said about it, but nothing I want to share with strangers who might taunt me in public). Then, seeing as how I'm currently sitting in a plane flying across the country, I took a feeble pass at how I feel simultaneously powerless and awestruck when strapped into a slender metal tube that is soaring through the sky. During this last piece I never actually wrote the word ""sophomoric,"" but a thin, nasal voice in my head kept repeating it over and over. And finally, I tried to make sense of my new position on D&G as a consultant, while at the same time wrestling with the cultural implications and definition of the word ""has-been."" (For the record, I defined a has-been as a someone who did something which resulted in their becoming a somebody, but then stopped doing it, causing them to revert to being a someone, which is not nearly as good as a somebody.) It should come as no surprise that I was soundly defeated in this semantic battle as well. Which leaves me with no vanity card this week. I just hope you know I tried. I really, really tried."
"Sep 25th, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #84    <br/><br/><br/><br/>In certain cultures people greet each other with a little bow and their hands pressed together in a prayer position. This is meant to convey that one acknowledges the divinity in the other. In our culture we greet each other by shaking hands, a gesture meant to convey the cheery thought, ""See? I'm not holding a weapon."" Personally, I like the divinity ""hi, how are ya"" a lot better. In fact, sometimes I like to walk down the street and remind myself that each and every person I see is of divine origin and on a journey that is unique, profound, tragic, joyous and, to them, immensely important (airports are also good for this exercise). Now that's not to say that I don't often consider others as being mere speed bumps on my little drive through life. I just find that when I make the slightest effort to acknowledge that spark of divinity in the people I meet, I feel better. Life is less threatening. I feel safer. More inclined to being open and loving. More inclined to leave the safety on."
"May 22nd, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #83    <br/><br/><br/><br/>The first time I got married I was twenty-six years old. I wasn't nervous. I was filled with certainty as to the rightness of my decision. I was centered and calm and blissfully unaware of all the challenges that lay ahead. My consciousness was completely unaware of my own shortcomings and how they would spring up at a later date to do what they do best. In short, I was twenty-six and dumber than soup. As I write this I'm well into my forty-eighth year and preparing to marry for the second time. The event is scheduled to begin eight hours from now. I find it amusing that this time I'm riddled with fear to the point of mind-numbing disassociation. A zombie with a tux. Of course I have to assume that this difference in my awareness is a result of the extensive knowledge I now possess of both my defects of character and the pitfalls of relationships. I have to assume that. I really do. In the meantime, my plan for the rest of the day is to wander around with a goofy smile and try not to bump into the furniture. When it's finally time to walk down the aisle, I feel fairly confident that I'll be having an out-of-body experience as well as an inability to recognize my closest relatives. The good news in all this is I'm deeply in love with the bride. The bad news is... well, there is no bad news, unless you count the goofy smile."
"May 15th, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #79    <br/><br/><br/><br/>I believe that I suffer from two fundamental forms of fear: fear of not getting what I want, and fear of losing what I have. In that both stem from actual or ""perceived"" threats to my actual or ""perceived"" survival, I also believe that both aspects of fear are derived from my underlying fear of my actual or ""perceived"" death. It would then follow that a good deal of my daily anxiety is a result of my faulty perception. And by faulty perception I mean, ""wow, am I a whack job or what?"" Which leaves me with only two possible solutions regarding fear -- change my perception, or, failing that, ignore my perception. The reason I bring this up is that in the ever-widening world of self-improvement, I never see ""ignoring yourself"" offered up as a viable solution to problems of the mind. And yet, it works! Next time your head is filled with anxious thoughts, simply take note of it, thank your mind for trying to ensure your survival, then act as if you just got a stock tip from a homeless person. Of course, ignoring fear messages no longer applies if you're standing in line at the post office and the guy behind you is hiding something beneath a large overcoat and audibly talking to God."

As a general rule, the only time I ever do anything with the number eighty attached to it is play fifteen holes of golf. But I can now look back with pride on having had the discipline and creativity to communicate something of value eighty times. Now I know some of you are thinking the phrase ""something of value"" might be overstated. Well, may I remind you, I've always had the option to create a vanity card which had value only to to me (a photo of my dog drinking from the toilet springs to mind). Instead, I chose to wrestle words into some sort of meaningful form... eighty times. Have I been successful? That will have to be determined by people who haven't written eighty vanity cards. What remains indisputable, however, is that the deed is done. Eighty vanity cards can be read, relished, or rejected. I now have something in common with the legendary author, Jules Verne. He wrote a story entitled, Around The World In Eighty Days. I wrote eighty vanity cards. At this rate, it won't be long before I have something in common with secret agent Maxwell Smart's beautiful partner and a lot of bottles of beer on the wall.

As I ramble into the third sentence I remain clueless as to what my theme or motif might be. Of course, my lack of theme might be exactly what I'm looking for. Perhaps this is more of a jazz-style vanity card. A riff. An improvisation that strips words of their meanings and hurls them at the reader like cascading arpeggios from a tenor sax as played by a guy with a porkpie hat and a nasty predilection for a major export of Southeast Asia. BEGIN RHYTHM SECTION: Shotgun Momma with more than she needs to get the job done. Smoke-colored dogs running from a gasoline alley. Perfect. Talk to me about the brutality of your skin.

"Apr 3rd, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #77    <br/><br/><br/><br/>Once again, I'm sitting in an impossibly bad mood. This one's gone beyond the normal mental stew of fear, depression and resentment, and has morphed into a nasty physical sensation encompassing my entire body. The reason for the mood is almost besides the point. To the best of my knowledge, I have no power to change the conditions which brought it about. Which leaves me where? Well, as far as I can tell, it leaves me with nothing but these ugly feelings, a desire to be free of them, and the knowledge that I have never been able to lift myself out of my emotional state through the force of my will (the force of bourbon, sure -- but the force of my will, never). The only thing I have even the vaguest control over is my attitude which preceded the precipitating, bad mood-causing event. That attitude could best be described as a fiercely held conviction that people are supposed to behave in a Chuck-approved manner. When they don't, Chuck immediately becomes the organic repository for the aforementioned bad mood. Now one might deduce that my only escape from these foul states of mind is to discard my fiercely held conviction. But to do that, I'd have to lovingly accept a world that infrequently lives up to my expectations. In other words, I'd have to be somewhat God-like (assuming an all-forgiving God). Which means that in vanity card #78 I'll have to start working on a plan 'B'."
"Mar 27th, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #75    <br/><br/><br/><br/>As I write this I'm being interviewed by Jeannie McDowell, a reporter for Time magazine. Jeannie's writing an article about comedy on television. She agreed to let me take notes of the interview for my vanity card, but I'm not sure she really knew what a vanity card was. Throughout the Q & A, I try to maintain a mildly-amusing, self-deprecating manner. When asked why TV comedies are struggling these days, I cleverly quip that maybe the problem lies in poor diet or lack of exercise -- but I don't think she writes that down. When she asks about the proliferation of ""dramadies,"" my response is immediate, sharp and insightful. But, neurotically afraid to offend, I hedge my bet by adding that maybe audiences prefer a show that succeeds at being amusing, rather than fails at being funny. I also mention that the media doesn't write treatises about movie comedies sucking because they're not shoved down our throats every week like bad TV shows are. Unfortunately, I can tell that's not a good sound bite -- even for print, which requires, I guess, ""print bites."" I sense that the interview isn't going well so my mind begins to wander. I imagine a sitcom about a reporter for Time magazine who's interviewing a writer. He's a smart, sexy writer..."
"Mar 13th, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #76    <br/><br/><br/><br/>As I write this there exists a substantial threat of strikes in the film and TV business -- first from the writers guild, then from the actors guild. Well, I'd like to make a prediction. I predict that after all the yelling and finger-pointing is over, when the smoke finally clears, the single issue that will actually be the cause of these strikes will be... the internet. The folks who run the conglomerates that own the companies that produce the various entertainment products have seen the future. And that future, despite the NASDAQ's current problems, is the internet -- what's on it, who owns what's on it, and, most importantly, who profits from what's on it. As the future of this incredible, planetary network is being fought over, I can't help but think back to the first time I logged on in 1989. For a nominal sum, I signed up for Compuserve. If I recall correctly, I had 2400 baud. There was a dial tone, a horrible noise, then, miracle of miracles, a world of goofy teenagers chatting with each other via badly written sentences. I sat there and marvelled that my little computer was suddenly linked to other little computers in faraway places. I marvelled, then I logged off. It was incredibly slow and boring. Well, it's not slow and boring anymore. And it may put a lot of people out of work for a very long time. Which, IMHO, isn't a LOL situation. :)"

I have to tell you, it's been a very humbling experience. It's an experience that's caused many hours of self-reflection, self-doubt, and, on a few occasions, debilitating bouts of depression, rage, paranoia, and a mild lack of appetite -- nothing unhealthy, I'm just not very hungry (mostly at night, but I think I sleep better on an empty stomach). My point is, we work really hard on this show and when we lose in the ratings it just plain hurts. There's nothing to be done about it except to sit in the pain and pray for it to pass. Of course you could call twenty friends and encourage them to watch the show. That might help. I'm not actually saying you should do that. But you could... if you cared. I'd do it for you.

Since I was a little kid I've known that (like it or not) there were an awful lot of people who had a lot more on the ball than I did. Oh, believe me, I've tried to suppress this awareness. I've tried to convince myself that I was special, that I was gifted. But I eventually learned that this secret could be my greatest asset.

"Jan 30th, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #71    <br/><br/><br/><br/>Interesting Dharma & Greg facts: In the first draft of the first script Greg had a teenage sister who was a pyromaniac. Also in that script was a scene where Dharma's dad was about to be arrested for plants growing on his property that he swore did not belong to him -- while at the same time insisting he had a prescription for glaucoma. The first time I met Jenna was at a breakfast meeting. I ate before she arrived so she wouldn't see what a sloppy eater I was. The original inspiration for these vanity cards came from exec producer Bill Prady, who has also edited each and every one. There's no way I can confirm this, but I suspect Bill might be the smartest man in the world (edit that, buddy). In the first episode exec producer Don Foster came up with the immortal lines for Dharma, ""Comb your frog,"" and, ""Drive your coffee table to Idaho."" I can't confirm this either, but I suspect Don might be a bodhisattva, a fully-realized soul who has voluntarily returned to the physical plane to help lesser souls achieve spiritual freedom. The actual premise of D&G was inspired by the Bruce Springsteen song ""She's the One"" on Born to Run (which has one of the great Bo Diddley riffs of all time). The first time I heard the word dharma was in 1968. The debut Jethro Tull album, (a killer album by the way, far superior to Aqualung) had a song entitled ""Dharma for One."" For the next twenty-five years I didn't know what the word meant. Now I do."

First off, I want to congratulate Al Gore on a hard-won victory. What a hoot it was to see the vice-president dance the horah with Tipper at the inauguration. I'm also delighted that I took a deep breath and jumped into the stock market with both feet in August when it hit its all-time low. What a buying opportunity that turned out to be! And how about that Eminem country album, huh? It's a little dark, but man, it's all I've been playing in my car for two weeks now. Needless to say, we all mourn the passing of Howard Stern. And finally, the really big news -- I know I'm going out on a limb here, but what if I'm right? -- who would have thought that we'd finally make contact with an alien race during halftime at the Super Bowl? Boy, that was a shocker. The Jets came back from a four touchdown deficit to pull off the upset of all time. Oh, Howard, I wish you could've been here with us to see it."
"Jan 9th, 2001","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #69    <br/><br/><br/><br/>I recently pierced the veil of a long-standing delusion which I had considered to be reality. The delusion was simply this: I thought people were deeply aware of me. I thought the things going on in my life -- my work, relationships, problems, joys, thoughts, insights, attitudes, tastes, desires, fears, good hair days, bad hair days, choice of pants (that's right, choice of pants), etc. ad delusium, were all of some significance to other people. I'm not certain, but I think the delusion is a twisted sort of family heirloom, a neurotic hand-me-down of the fiercely-held immigrant desire to fit in, to be acceptable. Be that as it may, the impact of this hallucination has been a constant state of low-grade anxiety. While it's still a little early to tell, it appears that freedom from it will create an enormous sense of relief and... well... freedom. You people out there, kind and considerate though you may be, don't really give a rat's ass about my life. You give a rat's ass about your life. This means I need no longer obsess over what others think of me (they don't). This means that I am, much to my amazement, more or less invisible. But most importantly, this means that I can begin living a fearless, delusion-free life that is fundamentally true to my basic, God-given nature. All that's left to do is discover what kind of pants my basic, God-given nature looks good in."

"Dec 12th, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #67     <br/><br/><br/><br/>As I write this I'm sitting in a big, dark cloud of anger. The feeling is highly energetic, almost electric, and, for some strange reason, seems to be most evident in my skin. The experience is vaguely uncomfortable and is dissipating slightly as I write these words. Thinking back, I see now that there was a brief moment when I had a choice as to how I would react to the situation that led to my current condition. I could have just as easily chosen resignation, or amusement, or even sadness. So the obvious question is why did I choose a destructive emotion? I suppose that on some deep, unconscious level I must be hard-wired to believe that anger is the appropriate response. Which leads to the next obvious question: how does one undo a damaging mental process that appears to be inextricably woven into the organism itself? Well, let me state right here, that burning it out doesn't work. God knows I've tried and therefore will not be running for public office anytime soon. Thinking it away (which I'm doing now), is terribly ineffective. And I'm certainly not ready to line up at the great pharmaceutical ""happy"" trough. So what then? Well, perhaps I could give my anger away. I know it sounds silly, but maybe silly is what's called for. Perhaps I could simply give my anger to everyone reading this vanity card... whoa, suddenly I'm feeling very affable. CAUTION: This is not a chain letter. Do not pass the anger on. Gently put it in a box, bury it in your backyard and blame it on the dog when no grass grows on that spot."
"Dec 5th, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #66     <br/><br/><br/><br/>I've got to share something with you. Every time I write a vanity card, I'm quietly astonished that I get away with putting these things on television every week. I mean think about it, at the end of every episode of Dharma & Greg I get two seconds to communicate whatever's on my mind directly to millions of people. This is a remarkable thing, folks. Secret messages from a sitcom writer using the most powerful medium the world has ever known. Sixty-six cards at two seconds a piece means I've received a total of two minutes and twelve seconds of broadcast time to THINK OUT LOUD. Do you know what that kind of time costs? You don't have to be Bill Gates' building contractor to see that they can't keep letting me get away with this. In fact, just writing this might be some sort of death wish. Number 66, the card that killed the cards. The card that never aired. In years to come, people will talk in hushed tones about the fabled #66. Its very existence will be debated. Did Lorre actually write #66? If he did, was it so inflammatory that the big boys pulled the plug on the whole deal? Could it be that the missing #66 held the vital clue to the puzzle, the enigma, that was Chuck Lorre (graduate thesis, anyone?), or is what happened far more mundane? Number 66 was read by the network censors. They thought it a meandering mixture of hubris and paranoia that lacked a good solid joke at the end, but otherwise containing nothing to merit keeping it off television. One thing's for sure, if you're reading this, you know the answer -- but don't let that discourage you from talking about me in hushed tones."
"Nov 28th, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #65     <br/><br/><br/><br/>I recently spoke with a man who is tormented. He thinks he is tormented because he thinks he has a tormentor. He cannot think of a scenario wherein he leaves his tormentor and thus ends his torment. He thinks his only path to serenity is to destroy his tormentor. He thinks the appropriate weapon to accomplish this task is a lawyer. This got me to thinking that perhaps thinking was the real source of his torment. But how can that be? Don't we value thinking? Don't we worship great thinkers? How can this God-given gift that separates us from the animals be deemed a curse? Isn't the alternative to thinking, stupidity? Or is there another alternative? Ask yourself this question, ""When I have a good idea, do I think my way to it, or does it just hit me?"" Which brings me to the theme of this vanity card (finally). I'd like to suggest that we all have inspiration at our disposal at all times. How does inspiration work? How the hell would I know? I just know it's there. Nothing else but inspiration explains a great work of art, and nothing else but thinking could be responsible for making all those ""Lethal Weapon"" movies. I mentioned all this to the tormented man. I told him that perhaps he could find a solution to his troubles by quitting thinking and being open to inspiration. He said he thought I was a moron and threw his shoe at me. It just hit me."
"Nov 21st, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #64     <br/><br/><br/><br/>On October 18, 2000, I celebrated my forty-ninth birthday. I approached the day with a sense of mild dread. This was, after all, the last birthday before the Big Five-Oh, the age where juvenile behavior starts to look pretty pathetic (even in California). Anyway, the natal anniversary arrived and was warmly celebrated by friends and loved ones. I felt good. I felt - dare I say it - vaguely mature. Then my old friend and accountant Steve called to wish me well. We joked about getting old. Where have all the years gone? What about the music the kids listen to these days? How's your prostate? Etc. Then, thinking myself to be his elder, I inquired as to Steve's age. He replied that he'd be turning forty-eight in December. I quickly did the math and determined that since I graduated high school in 1970, he must have graduated in 1971. To my surprise, he said he graduated in 1970. I did some lightning fast re-calculations and asked if he skipped a grade. He said no. Then he asked a simple, penetrating question. He asked me what year I was born. I replied confidently, ""1952."" To which he, always the accountant, asked, ""Well, then how on earth can you be forty-nine?"" I started to protest, but then the impact of his question hit me like a wheelbarrow full of bricks falling on the head of a stupid person. Somewhere along the line, I don't know when, I had omitted a year of my life. But my friend, with his mysterious ability to add and subtract had returned it to me. I got some nice sweaters this year, but how often do you get the gift of life? I'm only forty-eight! Screw maturity! Neener, neener, neener!"
"Nov 14th, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #63     <br/><br/><br/><br/>Here's a funny thing. I've been trying to create a sympathetic male character in his early twenties for another project I'm working on. After struggling with a variety of generic, off-the-rack prototypes, I thought why not use myself as a template (at least myself as I was in my early twenties) -- which is where the funny part comes in. When I began using an autobiographical approach I discovered -- to my horror -- that I don't find the ""young me"" to be a particularly sympathetic character. Needless to say, this sort of thinking brings to light all kinds of personal issues I don't really feel are appropriate for a vanity card. But the question remains, what does it mean when you reflect on your life and find that you didn't make a very good hero? Your actions were either self-serving, thoughtless, shallow, craven, vain, vengeful, manipulative or, when you really got it going, all of the above. Well, it means that even though we go through life thinking of ourselves as the leading man, the truth is some of us are better cast as mischief-making sidekicks. Or, in a few cases, unwitting villains who have to learn to forgive themselves. Regardless, I've decided not to take any chances. I'm basing my sympathetic male character on a young Tom Hanks."
"Oct 31st, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #62     <br/><br/><br/><br/>It's strange to think of one's life as analogous to climbing a mountain. It's even stranger to discover, after years of striving to reach the summit, that it's the wrong mountain. This is what happened to Dave. Dave spent twenty years climbing the wrong mountain. And yet he had to consider it time well-spent. After all, no one could have told him he was relentlessly scaling the wrong pile of dirt (not that they didn't try). Dave had to find out for himself. Which is why, in the perverse way life happily screws with us, it turned out to be exactly the right mountain. In order to see things clearly, to understand the actuality of his existence, Dave had to crawl up a treacherous incline that only led to happiness in his poorly-formed, childish dreams. There was never an alternative mountain for ol' Dave, because he was incapable of envisioning one. So he climbed. Until one day, he looked around and saw that he'd reached the top. The pinnacle. The apex. The place where eagles crap. And that's when he noticed the mountain he was always meant to climb far off in the distance. And he noticed something else... everyone climbing that mountain was truly happy. So Dave did the only thing a sane man could do in his situation, he sent word to those people and told them they were on the wrong mountain."
"Oct 24th, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #61     <br/><br/><br/><br/>When I was a little kid my parents often used a phrase that, to their way of thinking, described the ancient art of meditation. The phrase was ""staring at one's belly button."" This bon mot was most often used to describe someone who was sitting on their butt practicing the equally ancient art of underachieving. ""Look at that guy over there staring at his belly button,"" would be considered an acceptable use of this witticism. Another common remark heard in my formative years was ""He's got a head on his shoulders,"" which was used to express admiration and respect. Smart people who were doing something with their lives had ""heads on the shoulders."" Those who were not quite so clever, well, there was another phrase for where their heads were. The reason I'm bringing this up is that while meditating recently I had a tremendous flash of insight -- I have never stared at my belly button, not while meditating, not while underachieving, and my head has always been on my neck. When I mentioned to my mother that my head was filled with these sorts of nonsensical sayings and I considered it a subtle form of child abuse, she told me not to be such a Wisenheimer. Wisenheimer was an old country name that was later anglicized to Smartypants."
"Oct 10th, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #60     <br/><br/><br/><br/>Well, some things never change. I've had four and a half months to write this season's first vanity card -- four and a half months -- and here I am, the morning the damn thing is due, writing like a madman. If nothing else, this exercise in blind panic causes me to reflect on how I crawled out of high school in June, 1970. And to reflect on how my son, following in his father's hand and kneeprints, executed the same escape maneuver in June, 2000. And finally, how thirty years from now, perhaps his son will be putting off for tomorrow what could have easily been done today. Procrastination. I'm good at it. Since I began writing this vanity card, I've managed to peruse both the L.A. and New York Times, drink yet another cup of coffee, hide in the bathroom to read a few more precious pages of a Philip Roth novel. (Reading Roth causes me to seriously question my vocation. It's sort of the prose version of when I was a young, journeyman guitarist and I first heard Pat Metheny. I think that was around 1974.) Anyway, procrastination... oh, look! I'm out of room! The space constraints of the vanity card have forced me to stop writing before I'm able to cleverly fini"
"May 16th, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #59     <br/><br/><br/><br/>A friend of mine recently asked me if I was responsible for any of the countless jokes that are told in offices and homes throughout the country. His question certainly had a valid premise. One would assume that comedy writers write jokes. Following that line of reason he thought, well, Chuck's a comedy writer (remember, he's my friend), ergo Chuck must write some of these ""a guy goes into a bar with a duck on his head"" deals. Well, I had to tell him that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, I've sat in many rooms with many talented comedy writers and every one of them was as mystified as I was as to the origin of jokes. What wonderful madman writes ""a pig this good you don't eat all at once?"" What evil genius cooked up the comic recipe for ""I feel good, but I look awful?"" I don't know. But if you're out there and you dreamed up ""You want me to numb that for you, Mrs. Johnson?"", thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you."

Well, actually, you really don't have to. I just wanted to start the card off with some excitement. To tell you the truth, now I feel a little guilty. After all, aren't we misled enough in this life without having to be duped into reading a Chuck Lorre Productions Vanity Card? Isn't our attention vitally needed at home, at the job, with our children, husbands, wives, parents, and friends? Shouldn't we be using this precious time to call our hermaphroditic, cross-addicted cousin and talk him into giving himself up to the authorities? Wouldn't it be better for all of us if these golden, never-to-come-again moments were used to sneak into work after everyone has gone and take that stupid nanny-cam out of the ladies room? Well, we might as well face it, that's not going to happen now. And all because of two completely duplicitous sentences: YOU MUST READ THIS VANITY CARD! FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S SACRED, YOU MUST READ THIS VANITY CARD!! What was I thinking? I'm so ashamed."
"May 2nd, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #57     <br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the great blessings of getting older is realizing, without shame and remorse, what an idiot you've been at earlier stages of your life. I can think of nothing that breeds humility better than this on-going epiphany. The knowledge that with a few exceptions, I was the human version of the ""don't pass"" bet on a craps table, is oddly comforting. Let's take a look. In 1977 I tried to talk a friend out of investing all his money in stores that only sold running shoes. A few years later, I told anyone who would listen that the female singer of ""Lucky Star"" was a one-hit wonder, while the singer of ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" was here to stay. I saw no future in bottled water or fancy coffee shops. Cellular phones? What for? I already have a phone. And let's not forget that in 1988 I read William Gibson's ""Neuromancer,"" logged onto the Internet, and STILL didn't see it coming. Shall I go on? Shall I share with you some of the moronic things I've done, thought and said in my personal life? Of course I won't. I'm not stupid. I'm just humble."

Turn and look at someone near you -- a loved one, a friend, a co-worker, a stranger -- it doesn't really matter. Now, as you look at this person, consider this: he or she is a completely unique, never - before - in - the - history - of - the - universe - has - there - been - anyone - exactly - like - this - person... person. Reflect on the fact that you are gazing at an impossibly complex and totally original work of art which will never be duplicated. I'm sure you see where I'm going with this. We so easily lose sight of how truly magnificent we are. Which is something to keep in mind if you chose to look at a stranger for this exercise. Even though he's looking back at you with grinning, spittle-covered lips that are a miraculous construct of living tissue -- even though perverse thoughts of what he'd like to do to you are racing through a meat-based computer that no Pentium chip will ever approximate, he is a masterpiece. If he were hanging in a museum, a security guard would most likely tell you, ""Don't touch."""

When I reflect on the people and events that led me to this moment in time, this ""place"" in my life, I am forced to conclude that a miracle -- no, a series of miracles -- has occurred. How else can a devastating car accident and a terrible illness turn out to be, in the long run, blessings? But then my inner critic says, ""Are you so self-obsessed as to believe that the hand of God moves through your puny life?"" Well, if I postulate an infinite God, the answer is, why not? The dictionary definition of infinite is ""having no boundaries or limits."" With that in mind it seems self-obsessed to think that the influence of something infinite wouldn't extend to me, or anyone else for that matter. Of course I could also postulate that we're all chemical accidents in a dead and meaningless universe. It just doesn't make a very interesting vanity card."

It's nice to see old friends at these show-biz shindigs. It's nice to be acknowledged by my peers and by members of the foreign press. And let's not forget, good work is its own reward.

Now if Sting is right, and we live in a universe of synchronicity, it then follows that a single episode of Dharma & Greg could bring peace to the Middle East. It could even bring peace to Sting.

"Feb 22nd, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #52     <br/><br/><br/><br/>NEWS! Chuck Lorre announced today that he was making his second run at purchasing Universal Studios. Lorre said, ""Back when they were on the block to Matsushita I offered to keep the company in American hands by personally buying it for one hundred thousand dollars -- eighty-eight five in cash plus a late model Jeep Cherokee with low miles. My offer was rudely rebuffed. The chaos that ensued under foreign ownership was my only satisfaction. This time around I'm upping my offer to a cool one million dollars -- all in cash, but I'd be open to throwing in a 1995 Mercedes sedan."" Lorre said his goal was twofold: to liberate Universal from the cruel yoke of Canadian domination and, once in charge, to quickly greenlight a big-budget motion picture based on ""Major Dad"". Lorre went on to say that if he failed in his bid for Universal, he would consider making a run at UPN. Lorre says for that coveted prize he's willing to go as high as eight thousand dollars and a home stereo system that is still under warranty."
"Feb 15th, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #51     <br/><br/><br/><br/>I've never understood the phrase ""God's will be done."" It certainly wasn't bandied about while I was growing up on Long Island. Were it not for TV and the movies, I probably would never have heard it at all (prune-faced sodbusters in the Old West seemed to say it a lot). The American psyche of the Fifties and Sixties celebrated our will, not God's -- and we believed our will was limitless. But thankfully, as I've gotten older, I've come to realize that my will is anything but limitless. I can will myself to knowledge, but not to wisdom. I can will myself to pleasure, but not to happiness. I can will myself to money, but not to a sense of security. I can will myself to veggies and aerobics, but not to good health. Hell, I can will myself to bed, but not to sleep. All of which leads me to conclude that my deepest desires were never attainable through the exercise of my will. There's a feeling of relief in that conclusion. And unless God has a Manhattan attitude towards people from Long Island, there's a small bit of hope."
"Feb 8th, 2000","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #50     <br/><br/><br/><br/>I was recently asked by a journalist why I write these vanity cards. It seemed like a simple enough question, but the truth is, I was stumped. Why do I write them? Not for money certainly, although I continue to hold out hope. Is it a creative exercise from which I derive great pleasure? Not really. I've always felt that the act of writing isn't nearly as enjoyable as the feeling that comes from ""having written."" So why do I do it? Well, after careful consideration I've come to believe that had I been even a moderately successful communicator in my formative years, I would feel little compulsion to communicate now. This leads me to wonder, would it have been appropriate to have told the journalist that I write these vanity cards because I was incapable of expressing myself as a youngster, a situation which caused me unbearable anguish and is only now beginning to dissipate? Maybe. But I didn't. I told him I write them because it's fun. And this leads me to a question: if he's writing about my writing, what kind of miserable childhood did he have?"

The phrase, popularized by Zen master Shunryu Suzuki, means exactly what it says -- the Zen mind is a beginner's mind. It has no preconceptions or fixed ideas. It is open, questioning and delighted. When I began in television, I had a beginner's mind, but over the years I acquired a mind that was filled with so much stuff that my creativity became frozen. My joy became a dim memory. Obviously the answer was to re-cultivate the ""beginner's mind."" Less obvious was how to jettison this ""acquired mind."" Well, after many months of meditation, I've done just that. The rules and boundaries of the ""acquired mind"" have been replaced with the wonder and delight of a child-like beginner's mind.

As each one spoke, I noticed I was making a snap judgement about that person. Sometimes the judgement was warm and appreciative. But more often, it was of the ""Geez, what a vacuum tube this guy is"" variety. At first I was troubled by this ugly mental reflex. But then I was hit with a flash of insight. As I gazed around the room I realized that if each person was animated by the same energy -- call it God, call it carbon-based, chemical doowhackies -- then each person was essentially life doing the best that it can. Suddenly my judgements were replaced by a pervasive feeling of love. Emboldened by my epiphany, I meditated upon a TV executive with whom I'd recently had difficult relations. I visualized this person not as an arrogant prig, but as ""life doing the best that it can."" Which is when my insight grew deeper. I now believe that the ability to suspend judgement and flow love works really well with complete strangers."

Nothing serious, just your average, common cold versus aspirin, antihistamines, vaporubs, humidifiers, throat lozenges, vitamins, homeopathic remedies, buckets of chicken soup that I can't smell, and enough squeezably-soft facial tissue to exfoliate my nose down to the skull. But what I find most fascinating is that while nothing's worked, I persist in thinking I can ""beat"" a common cold. Why am I incapable of accepting my helplessness? Is the inability to accept helplessness a survival trait or the cause of suffering? I can't amaze my friends at cocktail parties by levitating the dip, but I accept that I'm powerless over gravity and thus do not suffer. Likewise, I can't sing like Joe Cocker, but I accept my inability to emulate Ray Charles and feel just fine about it. Anyway, there won't be a vanity card this week. Geez, I feel clammy, maybe I should take some more zinc. Yeah, zinc, that'll do it."

That's not to say that I think prayer is a waste of time. In fact, I now believe that prayer is essential to a happy life -- just not the kind of prayer that asks for stuff. What I now believe is that the true purpose of prayer is for us to get our actions and thoughts into alignment with the universe as it really is, as opposed to how we wish it to be. If we assume an omnipotent God, then God is everything. In other words, God is the universe as it really is. With that in mind, I've been praying a lot lately so that I might properly align myself. The two messages I've received thus far are: ""be kind and loving"" and ""have fun while it lasts"". While I find that comforting, it troubles me that the two ideas seem incompatible.

I especially regret the gaffe since frankly, I should know better. I spent two years on ""Roseanne"" where I was repeatedly beaten over the head with a simple truth: ""fat"" jokes are cheap jokes. I was also told that I was an incompetent hack intent on destroying the show, but that's another matter for another vanity card.

He felt invincible. Ferocious storms battered him with wind and rain, great ships sliced through his very heart, and yet he rolled on. It was not for him to stop and consider the other waves. To stop was to die. Waves have to keep moving... or else. But then one day Dave saw a strange darkness on the horizon and, for the first time in his life, felt fear. What could it be? Was it connected to the laughing creature sliding across his face on a piece of wood? But before he could make sense of it all, he crashed down into the darkness. For a brief moment he felt a weird, splashing feeling, then oblivion. Dave was no more. He was now a part of the sea. And as we all know, the sea loves to make waves."

"Oct 5th, 1999","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #38     <br/><br/><br/><br/> Dear Dad, I want to apologize for being such a rotten son. I want to say how sorry I am for all the pain I brought into your life. For the years I humiliated you with my ridiculous hair, my moronic clothes and my stupid, stupid behavior. For all the times I ignored your heart-felt advice and hard-won wisdom. And finally, I want to apologize for despising you for reasons I still don't understand. Please know that my thoughts, words and actions were the best I had at the time. I also want to thank you for endowing me with a sense of humor. It has proven to be a priceless inheritance, and I don't use the word priceless loosely. You should see where I live. I also need to thank you for showing me what courage, strength and personal integrity looked like in action. I'm still trying to live up to that part of my inheritance. I miss you so much, Dad, and yet I feel your presence more and more with each passing year. Love, Chuck. P.S. You'll be happy to know that your grandchildren are a definite improvement on their father."
"Sep 28th, 1999","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #37     <br/><br/><br/><br/> I wanted to take this opportunity to welcome all my loyal vanity card readers back for year three of D&G. As you can see, I've changed the card to black print on a white background in the hope that this will facilitate reading while you ""pause"" your videotape. I also wanted to use this card to talk about what I did on my summer vacation. Rather than go to Europe, or some exotic locale, I chose to go on a spiritual journey. Among other things, my journey led to this stunning realization: For as long as I can remember, I've mistakenly felt that God, or some kind of higher power, had taken everyone aside and explained to them what this life was all about. And for some twisted, cosmic reason, it was decided that I alone would remain in the dark. Uncovering this self-centered misconception was an enormous breakthrough for me. For the first time in my life I didn't feel like an ignorant, frightened outsider. As a result, next summer, one more ignorant, frightened insider is going to Paris!"
"Sep 21st, 1999","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #36     <br/><br/><br/><br/> I recently mentioned to an engineer friend of mine that I get slightly crazed when things are less than perfect. To my surprise he looked at me with a crooked little smile and said, ""Oh, but things are perfect."" A few days later our conversation continued. This time he told me that the universe was expanding at exactly the right speed to keep it from flying apart or collapsing back into itself. He also noted that the subatomic makeup of our bodies was calibrated so magnificently that were it off by less than one percent, two human bodies approaching one another would release enough energy to blow the Earth out of its orbit. And consider this: if a plane loses its wings at thirty thousand feet, and DOESN'T fall to the ground, then we would be living in a world where fat people could stick rockets in their ass and fly to Miami for a three-day weekend. Now, if you're like me and don't find that to be an improvement on the laws of nature, then I think you have to agree with my friend -- things are perfect."

"May 19th, 1999","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #34     <br/><br/><br/><br/> The more I investigate the non-realm that lies just beyond, beneath or throughout the non-realm I think we're in, the more I'm convinced that it will take the heart of a warrior to continue. I suppose part of the reason for that is it requires courage to not be seduced by the comfort level generated by this particular illusion. Isn't it easier to just lay back and slip-slide into the daily grind of unconsciousness? And then there's the cultural conditioning which proclaims, ""This is it! What you see is what you get."" Now, let's think about that for a moment. What we see is what we get. Hmmm... We can't see electrons. We can't see a virus. We can't see getting an honest profit participation in anything we write -- and yet we still believe these things exist. Which brings me to God. Isn't it strange that we can look up at a night sky, at a majestic mountain, at the sculpted behind of a beautiful woman in spiked heels, and have trouble believing in God? But I digress."
"May 12th, 1999","I happen to believe that a life unexamined is a life not worth living. I also happen to believe that a life examined will cause an incredible amount of heartache. With that dilemma in mind, here's where my examination has gotten me so far. The only real progress I've made as a human being came at those times when my carefully constructed ego was completely shattered by people and/or events. Unfortunately, that progress was always short-lived because each and every incident of ego deflation was followed by years of building up a stronger, more resilient replacement. Son, friend, athlete, musician, rebel, space cadet, husband, daddy, TV writer-producer, divorced guy, jerk, smart guy, wiseguy, fool, seventeen handicap, success, failure are all false selves because they are fleeting processes with no real substance or permanence. So where does this leave Chuck Lorre? Egoless? I wish. But it does make one think, maybe Prince was on to something when he shed his name for a symbol. Hmmm..."

"Mar 31st, 1999","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #31     <br/><br/><br/><br/> There's a wonderful story about a learned man who went to see a Zen master to debate the merits of Zen. The master poured him a cup of tea, and purposely kept pouring so the tea ran over the cup and spilled onto the table. The man was startled and asked the master what he was doing. The Zen master replied, ""You are like this cup, too full of your own opinions to receive anything else."" Now I'd like to ask everyone reading this vanity card to empty yourselves of all your opinions, beliefs, fears, hopes, resentments and desires for just one moment. Just let them all go... empty your cup. Good. Some call this emptiness nirvana -- attained by years of meditation. I would suggest that there's another path to attain this state of emptiness: write and produce twenty-four sitcom episodes in thirty-five weeks. Which is the origin of another Zen riddle: if no one hears a comedy writer weeping inconsolably while curled in a fetal ball, is he still funny?"
"Mar 3rd, 1999","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #30     <br/><br/> I feel that the alter-egos of Richie and Dave are beginning to wear out their welcome in my vanity cards. The spiritual searcher, ""Richie,"" is named after my childhood friend, a gentle giant and bonafide genius. ""Dave"" is derived from the classic Cheech and Chong piece ""Dave's not here."" I used Richie and Dave to explore themes I was personally uncomfortable with. As fictional characters, I could send them charging into emotional, intellectual, moral, sexual and spiritual machine gun nests, while I sat safely behind the lines. This is literary cowardice. Beginning now, any vanity card musings will be written from my own point-of-view.<br/><br/>  ""Wait one darn minute! I'm real, and so is Dave! This should actually be called The Richie and Dave Vanity Card!""     ""You're damn right, Richie. If anyone's fictional, it's Chuck Lorre.""<br/><br/> Uh-oh, little help?"
"Feb 24th, 1999","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #29     <br/><br/> As an experiment, I just set my computer's calendar to 1/1/00. So far so good. The system seems to be dealing with the 00 date without too much trouble. Although I did just notice that President McKinley is running for re-election, and Americans are certainly smelling better, now that one home in seven has a bathtub. On a sour note, bubonic plague has struck Honolulu and the entire city had to be set on fire to destroy the disease-carrying rats. I just read about a fellow named Harvey Firestone who claims to have a bright idea about attaching rubber tires to rims. Rubber tires? What good will those be on trolley cars? Finally, as I sit here on my porch, sipping lemonade, I feel comfortable in predicting that the 20th Century will be a peaceful one."
"Feb 17th, 1999","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #28        <br/><br/>When I was a young man I got this guitar and sorta learned how to make it talk. Not as articulately as the guys I worshipped, but I did manage to get that old Strat to speak with a certain fluency and syntax. On good nights, I could make it scream with anger or cry like a baby. There were even times when my hands did things that would utterly surprise me -- when the thousands of hours of practice exploded into music that seemed to come from someone else entirely. I couldn't imagine a life without three pickups and that cool setting between treble and midrange. But eventually I realized my teenage dream was turning into an adult nightmare. In order to provide for my family, I traded the six-string Fender for a four-camera sitcom. I guess in hindsight it was a good trade, although on good nights while writing and producing ""Roseanne,"" ""Grace Under Fire"" and ""Cybill,"" you could hear me screaming and crying like a baby."
"Feb 10th, 1999","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #27        <br/><br/>When Richie figured out that the universe truly was an illusion, he was quite dumbfounded at the simplicity of the insight. Unless some sort of awareness exists to perceive the whole shabang, the whole shabang effectively does not exist. It could be an infinite space filled with stars and planets, or a plaid snot rag wrapped around a bottle of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. Or, to put it another way, when a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, there is no sound. For a sound to be a sound, there must be some sort of ear hooked to some sort of intelligence that says something like, ""What was that?"" Otherwise the sound might as well be a plaid snot rag wrapped around a bottle of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. So now Richie understood that energy and mass only exist because of awareness, which means they have no inherent existence. Of course he had this insight while fighting a bad head cold, so that might have had something to do with it."

"Jan 20th, 1999","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #25        <br/><br/>I wanted to take this opportunity to wish all my faithful vanity card readers a Happy New Year. I also wanted to thank all those tireless people who transcribe the ol' card and upload it onto the Internet. I'm hoping '99 will be a great year for the vanity card, filled with fresh insights into the meaning of life and plenty of pithy zingers that bring a smile to one and all. I don't have anything insightful or pithy at the moment. Truth is, I'm vamping like crazy here. Just killing time, looking for a clever point of view, a sweepingly original articulation on the mystery of life, anything. Oh hell, who am I kidding? This has become a terrible burden -- week after week, exec produce D & G and write this freaky vanity card. No, ""Sit, Ubu, sit"" for me. Nooo, I had to create a monster -- a voracious little stinker that gnaws at my peace of mind like a slightly irregular freckle which could be melanoma... but I digress. HAPPY NEW YEAR, EVERYBODY!"
"Jan 6th, 1999","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #24        <br/><br/>To pierce through the illusion of separateness, to realize that which lies beneath the tormenting wound of duality -- that was a goal worthy of a lifetime. Richie, however, never really believed he could unravel this mystery which had baffled the greatest minds of humankind. He certainly didn't have anything resembling a great mind. Then it occurred to him... maybe a great mind was not what was needed to see behind the veil of illusion. Maybe true perception comes from a great heart. This realization troubled Richie, for he knew in his gut that he didn't have a great heart either. But then he thought, perhaps with some desperation, maybe the secret was in having a great gut. Or nice shoes."
"Dec 16th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #23        <br/><br/>My eulogy. I know I'm not dead, I just thought it would be kinda cool to write it myself, while I'm alive and well, and stick it on the end of a TV show. Okay, first, I meant well. Despite all the things for which I need to be forgiven, in my heart I know I meant well. I believe that my sins were driven by fear -- fear of being unloved, fear of poverty, fear of death, fear, fear, fear. What can I say? I was deeply influenced by a frightened mother. I'm not casting blame here; God knows what she dealt with as a little kid. Second, I tried hard. When it came to taking care of my children, I allowed nothing to get in my way -- even a closer relationship with them. I attribute that sin to ""fear of being a bad provider."" There's so much more to say but as you can see, space is limited. I'll continue eulogizing myself on future vanity cards. In the meantime, there's nothing to fear but fear itself... and lethal diseases, random violence, and tragic accidents."
"Dec 9th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #22        <br/><br/>If he had pondered the problem for a hundred years, Hollywood agent Mort Tayback couldn't have dreamed of a better way to kill her. His plan was elegant and simple... he would make Carolyn famous -- and not just Courtney Cox famous or David Schwimmer famous. For Mort's murder to work, he'd have to make Carolyn a legend, an international icon, a transcendent luminosity upon whom men, women and children from San Bernadino to Zimbabwe would dream about. He liked the sound of that -- ""San Bernadino to Zimbabwe!"" Carolyn, of course, wouldn't feel like she deserved such adulation (and who does, really). At which point she'd quickly descend into a deadly spiral of drugs and miscellaneous self-destructive behavior, culminating in her untimely death. The world would mourn, but not Mort Tayback. For this was his perfect plan of revenge, based on a maniacally simple premise: ""If you want to kill someone you hate, make them famous."""
"Nov 25th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #21        <br/><br/>It was a novel thought for Dave: What if he's not someone who is perpetually in need of repair? What if the real grunt work of self-improvement is simply being aware of the things one thinks, feels, says and does? Dave decided to put his novel thought to the test by being aware of the first feeling that came along. As it turned out, his first brain guest was the feeling of horny. Dave was aware that he was horny. But, his awareness told him he was not so much horny as lonely. And the loneliness was really just a deep-seeded fear that he was unworthy of being loved......even by himself. Suddenly, Dave no longer felt horny. Now he felt hungry. But not so much hungry as sad. And the sadness was really just a deep-seeded fear that he was unworthy of being loved......even by himself. Which caused Dave to no longer feel hungry. Now he felt insane. But, that was okay because he was aware of it. And it wasn't so much insane as psychotically giddy."
"Nov 18th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #20        <br/><br/>Richie was in perfect health when he began reviewing his life. His reasoning was simple: if your life passes before you moments before you die, why not do it when things are going good? That way, when you're coughing up blood and forgetting your childrens' names, you can just lay back and enjoy the morphine-drip carpet ride that takes you back to God. Richie's life review began with his teenage years because his actions during those years effectively blocked out all memory of the preceding years. He began slowly, looking for moments when he'd been kind and loving, generous and cheerful. Unfortunately, all he could remember was a bewildered, terrified, selfish, horny, angry, pimple-faced knucklehead. But that was okay. Part of the life review involved extending forgiveness. So Richie forgave that miserable teenager of long ago and began scanning his young adult years. Which is where he found a treasure trove of memories that caused him to cough up blood and forget his childrens' names."
"Nov 11th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #19        <br/><br/>The carotid artery. I think that's what it's called. The big blood vessel in the neck -- maybe it's the jugular, I don't know. Whatever you call it, the damn thing was spouting blood, probably with each beat of his heart. It was late, I was coming back from a gig and saw his car wiped-out on the side of the road. I pulled over and tried to help. I knew the thing to do was to somehow stop the bleeding, but my hands were frozen. Instead, I told an unconscious teenager to hang in there, everything would be okay. A better Good Samaritan joined me eventually. He found an old shirt in the car and applied pressure to the kid's neck while I directed traffic. Then a cop arrived and told us that he would take over. I nodded, got in my Corolla and slowly drove home. That was twenty years ago. I still think about that kid and my frozen hands."
"Nov 4th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #18         <br/><br/>Surrender is a powerful word. It runs directly counter to everything Dave was taught. Dave was taught to fight for dominance -- to struggle to be the best. And after years of doing just that, Dave finally arrived at the mountaintop, the pinnacle, the hallowed place where eagles crap. But Dave was still unhappy, because no matter how hard he fought, winning was an illusion -- a mirage. But then, Dave thought, what would happen if I just gave up? This universe isn't meant to be dominated. It's an incomprehensible vastness which created us and to which we'll all return. So Dave surrendered and discovered a happiness he never dreamed of. A sea of bliss in which he willingly drowned. But then, he met this guy who was even happier and more blissful. You can guess the rest."
"Oct 28th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #17          <br/><br/>Dave still had vivid memories of when his mind was a quiet, useful ally -- a handy-dandy accessory that would discreetly remind him not to stick his little Dave fingers into light sockets. But that was long ago. Dave's mind was now in full revolt. One moment it would be idling nicely, waiting to notice, judge, critique or consider -- then, without warning, like a spider monkey on metha-amphetamines, it would start thinking ugly, angry, snarling monstrosities. Dave didn't know what to do. It was the only mind he had. And then he realized, it was out of his control because it was never his mind. It was just some scanning mechanism generated by billions of years of evolution, genetics, and conditioning. That made Dave feel better.

He rented a medium-priced banquet hall and invited all of his friends, family and co-workers to the happy event. But when the big day arrived, many were confused. There was Richie, walking and talking, actually having quite a good time. What kind of death was this? What Richie had failed to explain in the invitations was that the death he was celebrating was that of his carefully constructed ego. From this day on, Richie would cease to be Richie (except for tax purposes). For all other purposes he would simply be a continuously unfolding manifestation of the universe -- a process not a thing. He tried to explain how blissfully liberating this was, that this was the enlightenment sought by wise men throughout the ages, but no one really understood. Of course it didn't help matters much that he kept pestering several female guests to show the continuously unfolding manifestation their sweater puppies."
"Oct 14th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #15          <br/><br/>Dave was mildly disoriented when he realized he and Richie were the same person. This sort of cognitive moment tends to undermine a guy's sense of self. But it didn't stop there. When Dave looked around the room, he realized he was also Kate and Lorraine and Ted and Lenny. Heck, he was also the dying philodendran on the windowsill. Suddenly he felt enormous compassion for all these variations on himself, or rather ""ourself"", which he thought was a more appropriate label. The pain of loneliness and the fear of death were suddenly swept away by this one blinding flash of insight. It was so obvious! There are no separate forms of life. Life was life, just sort of wandering around looking at itself, loving itself, and unfortunately killing itself. Which is when Dave woke up, *#@+, showered and shaved, went to work, worried about nonsense, drove home, watched a supposedly funny show, had a stiff drink and went to sleep again."
"Oct 7th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #14          <br/><br/>Some days Richie would wake up crying. His first thoughts would be of Kate and the emptiness he felt without her. Those were the darkest days. The days when the pain of her rejection reached back and formed an alliance with his earliest childhood memories. The woman who couldn't love him now and the woman who couldn't love him then, working together like a Sino-Soviet monolith lumbering toward total Richie domination. So, bright boy that he was, he worked hard, drank hard, and chased soft women. Anything to forget. Anything to kill the pain. Until his dream came true. Until that amazing day when Kate came to him and said she had been wrong, that Richie was indeed the man for her and she wanted them to be together always. Which is when Richie suddenly realized that Kate was nuttier than rat crap in a pistachio warehouse. Richie still wakes up crying."
"Sep 30th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #13          <br/><br/>Dave really looked like he was paying attention. He smiled, pursed his lips and nodded as if he were giving their comments and criticisms much thought. And why wouldn't he? They were the Grand Pooh-Bahs who protected the simple folk from unnecessary art. But the truth is, Dave's mind was elsewhere. And that's not just a figure of speech. His mind was actually in one of those little butt bags that kids like to wear these days. Now, of course, Dave didn't start the meeting with his mind in a butt bag. When one of the muckamucks was summing up a vague thesis with a meandering generality, Dave's mind was very much in and around his head. But then, on its own volition, Dave's mind imagined all the attendees dancing around naked and squirting one another in their private parts with brightly-colored water pistols. And that was when it happened. That was when Dave's mind inexplicably slipped into a butt bag... right alongside his heart."
"Sep 23rd, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #12          <br/><br/>Richie didn't know he was beginning a journey into darkness when he made love to Kate. All he knew was bliss. For a few surreal hours his identity simply melted away. Of course, he tried to maintain his objectivity. Sex for Richie was traditionally an ego-ridden activity -- an athletic event designed to win the ""you're incredible"" trophy. But something else happened that night with Kate. He actually made love. He kissed her with love. He touched her with love. And finally, he entered her with a sense of devotion that dissolved all the fear boundaries which had caused him to be so alone. Unfortunately, Kate was just drunk and horny. Nothing even remotely special was happening in her camp. Richie had his first nervous breakdown shortly thereafter, although he preferred to think of it as a learning experience."

"May 20th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #11         <br/><br/>In February of '97, Dottie and I set out to create a series revolving around a woman whose personality is not a neurotic product of societal and parental conditioning, but of her own free-flowing, compassionate mind. In short, we tried to create a character we personally knew nothing about. Then the most astonishing thing happened: this fictional character began to teach us to think differently. For instance, while writing, we'd be forced to ask, ""how would Dharma deal with the emotion of anger?"" Oh sure, she'd feel it -- feel it completely. But then she'd be just as likely to let it go like a cluster of ugly balloons. Okay, fine, she'd let it go. How did she let it go? Probably by recognizing that no matter what the circumstances, emotions are self-generated. No one reaches inside your brain and flips the ""anger"" switch. So what does that teach us? Well, for me it means that all the anger I feel toward Cybill is ultimately created by... me. Whoa, there goes an ugly balloon! Thanks, Dharma!"
"May 13th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #10         <br/><br/>When I began writing these vanity cards, the premise was simple -- it's a vanity card -- be vain. And what could be more vain and self-serving than to use my two seconds of ABC's broadcast day to share my personal beliefs with millions of viewers? But as time passed I realized I was missing a major opportunity. Rather than just tell a few jokes, I could use the two seconds to unravel the mysteries of life and death and share my discoveries with those of you who can operate a VCR or log onto the Internet sites where my words are regularly posted (yes, I lurk). So, anyway, that's the new plan. The meaning of life, once a week, right here at the end of each Dharma & Greg show. HOW'S THAT FOR VAIN, BUCKO?!  Okay, let's get started. The secret of life is we're all writing a vanity card. I'm not kidding, follow me on this. If we're in agreement with the concept ""I think, therefore I am,"" then what are we in those rare moments when we're not thinking? Do we cease to be? No, of course not... unless we never ""were"" at all, unless our actual identity is a nothing that embraces everything, but an ""everything"" can't look at itself so we create the illusion of separate selves, which leads to the illusion of survival, which of course leads to all of our pain and suffering. Pride, i.e. vanity, goeth before the fall. And you thoughteth I was joking."
"Apr 28th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #9          <br/><br/>I believe I think too much. I believe I'm literally drowning in a thick swamp of thoughts. No, swamp's not right. It's more like being in the middle of a swarm of bees, all of them flying insanely about, occasionally stinging for no apparent reason. Yup, bees, definitely -- thoughts are bees. In fact, I believe my entire understanding of the world is based on my thoughts, which are generated by my emotions, which are generated by ... well, I guess my reaction to stuff that happens. Anyway, I understand the world through the filter of my thoughts and emotions. If this is pretty much how you understand the world, it brings up an interesting concept. Probably since we were infants, none of us have directly perceived this world we live in. What does it mean to directly perceive something? Well, I suppose it would mean to be totally with that thing, as opposed to observing and thinking about it. It's a duality issue. Here's me, here's you. here's me, here's the sofa. Ya dig where this is going? We live on a planet dominated by a race of beings whose only connection to reality is constantly buzzing, mental bees. We're all walking through life in a dream state that is, at best, a funhouse mirror-image of what's really out there. It makes you think, doesn't it? Ouch! Dammit!"
"Apr 1st, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #8                    I believe that words have power.

As you read the following words notice whether you feel the impulse to smile. Did it work? Did you smile immediately upon reading that? If not, that's okay. Don't get down on yourself. Remember, this is just an experiment. We can try it again. This time feel your lips curl up gently at the corners. You try to fight it, but your mouth seems to have taken on a life of its own. As you continue reading you can't help but notice that you are now smiling like the execs at Paramount after they realized they got a piece of Titanic for chump change. See? The power of words. In this case used for good. If you would like an example of words used for evil, call your mother and tell her you're really starting to make progress in therapy."
"Mar 4th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #7                    I believe that the very act of believing in something causes us to distance ourselves from that thing, thus a duality is created: oneself and the thing in which one believes. Now since we all know that in order to fully understand a thing one must be that thing -- walk a mile in its shoes so to speak -- it seems obvious that the state of believing in something inevitably causes us to not truly understand that thing in which we believe. This noncomprehension leads to all sorts of difficulties. ""I believe in love"" has a better than even chance of leading to divorce, while ""I believe in God"" seems to end in variations on the Spanish Inquisition. But -- and it's a big but -- if one were love, one couldn't help but be affectionate and caring towards oneself and others. If one were God, one would act toward all beings and all things as if they were one's own creations. And that, my friends, is the secret of life in a two-second vanity card. Of course, the secret could also be ""Sit, Ubu, sit."" We have to keep an open mind."
"Feb 25th, 1998","CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #6                    Once again, thank you for videotaping ""Dharma & Greg"" and freeze-framing on my vanity card. For those of you who are new, this is my sporadic attempt to share my personal beliefs with millions of people (hence the term ""vanity""). This attempt has led me into communicating many deep thoughts, and, I'm afraid to say, quite a few shallow ones as well. But what I've found most interesting is that after a few weeks, I've discovered myself scrounging for new beliefs. Things about which I could stand up and say with pride, ""I believe in this, dammit!"" Now that's not to say that I couldn't fill the card with a lot of mindless aphorisms. But do I waste my precious moment in the sun by proclaiming, ""I believe that sex with multiple partners in a moving vehicle isn't all it's cracked up to be?"" No, I do not. Do I squander this priceless opportunity to announce, ""I believe we are better than the animals because we're capable of reading in the bathroom?"" Once again, I do not. And so it is for this reason, I have no beliefs to share with you this week. No wait... actually I do believe that JFK had a much better understanding of the word ""perks""."

I know you're busy, so this shows a wonderful commitment on your part and I want you to acknowledge that commitment with a big ol' Chuck Lorre vanity card hug. Okay, with that done let's get on with why you're here, to learn more of my personal beliefs. I believe that this episode, which on the surface deals with a funny Valentine's adventure, in fact grapples with the weighty issue of Weltschmerz. Weltschmerz is a German word which loosely means ""world suffering deriving from the inevitability of reality to never match up with our expectations."" Boy, only the Germans could come up with a word like that. Anyway, in this episode Greg is in Weltschmerz hell as he discovers that life is never quite like the brochure. Dharma, on the other hand, recognizes that life is a flowing river and happiness exists only when one embraces its ever-changing nature. From this dilemma we draw the comedic essence of our story. Finally, I believe that when I retire and teach sitcom writing at a community college, I'll use this theme for one of my classes to impress the kids."

I believe that the guy who invented those speed bumps in the freeway that snap you back into consciousness when you're drifting into a nearby semi should be given a big hug. I believe that there are actually several cures for the summertime blues. I believe that in my earlier statement of beliefs, I erroneously believed that beer was a gateway drug that led to vodka. After intensive consultation with ABC executives, I now believe I was very, very wrong. Beer is good. Especially beer brewed by major manufacturers, and enjoyed in a responsible fashion. I believe I've spent my life expecting people to behave in a certain way. I believe that when they didn't behave according to my expectations, I became angry, sad, confused and occasionally fearful. I believe these expectations are the reason I've been angry, sad, confused and occasionally fearful more than I care to admit. As a result, I now believe my expectations are the real problem. I believe that everyone has this very same problem, and they ought to start acting accordingly. Well, that's all for now.

I believe that the Laws of Karma do not apply to show business, where good things happen to bad people on a fairly regular basis. I believe that what doesn't kill us makes us bitter. I believe that the obsessive worship of movie, TV and sports figures is less likely to produce spiritual gain than praying to Thor. I believe that Larry was a vastly underrated Stooge, without whom Moe and Curly could not conform to the comedy law of three (thanks, Lee). I believe my kids are secretly proud of me. I believe that if you can't find anything nice to say about people whom you've helped to make wildly successful and then they stabbed you in the back, then don't say anything at all. I believe I have a great dog, maybe the greatest dog in the whole wide world, yes, he is! I believe that beer is a gateway drug that leads, inevitably, to vodka and somebody oughta do something about it. I believe that when ABC reads this, I'm gonna be in biiiig trouble.

I’d like to take this opportunity to thank you for watching network TV. There was a time when thanks were not necessary. Network TV was your only choice. Oh sure, there were local television stations, but they mainly existed to provide you with local news and Plan 9 From Outer Space. If one were to take a karmic view of things, one might think that the rapidly diminishing reach of network TV is the in- evitable result of inferior shows. Ignoring the obnoxious use of the word “one”, that doesn’t explain Norman Lear, Steven Bochco, the Charles brothers, Jerry Seinfeld and Dharma & Greg. Another possible villain in this story of tragic decline could be commercials. Since the dawn of network television, the audience was entertained for free. You paid with your attention. Now, with streaming television, your attention is mostly irrelevant. You pay with money. Which makes me wonder, what would network TV look like if it dumped the commercials and charged viewers a small monthly fee (personally, I would gladly fork over a few bucks to never again see that %&@! Australian gecko). But that’s not likely to happen. Giant corporations don’t pivot. They lumber. They trudge. They slog. That said, network TV has been extremely good to me. So, once again, thanks for watching!"

The reason for this rule is that somewhere along the line idiots began calling the phone numbers used on TV shows and movies.  This resulted in production companies and networks being sued by the unhappy people who were harassed by the prank calls from the aforementioned idiots.  All of which means that whether you're trying to enjoy a humble sitcom or a hundred million dollar action movie, every phone number will begin with the hateful, illusion-wrecking prefix, 555.  In tonight's episode of Two and a Half Men we tried to get around this dilemma.  The phone number Charlie rattles off in the first scene is actually one number short of a real number.  Then, later in the scene, he discusses a memory trick which involves replacing numbers with letters in order to remember them.  If you check your phone, you'll see the letters we used, OXOFEMPAL, or 696-336-725, is again one number short of being an actual working number, and JKLPUZO is the broadcast acceptable 555-7896. A lot of work, not to mention endless negotiations with our CBS censor, was necessary to come up with these numbers.

These days it seems like every vanity card is getting scrutinized and criticized by network executives, corporate legal departments and publicity departments, TV journalists and tabloid bloggers.

I've always understood the Republican Party to have, as its central platform, the idea that human beings should never be dominated by a monolithic government which tells them how to live their lives.  I like that.  It feels like a fundamental truth, and I can't imagine any right-minded person finding fault with it.  I've also noticed that there are many in the Grand Old Party who insist on telling people exactly how they should live.  For example: Alcohol, yes.  Pot, no.  Straight marriage, yes.  Gay marriage, no.  Jesus, yes.  Others prophets, no.  The death penalty, yes.  Abortion, no.  Capitalism, yes (by force if need be).  Collectivism, hell no!  Added to this is an inclination to find anyone who chooses these other paths to be deeply repugnant.  All of which causes me to wonder, is there a middle ground?  In fact, are there big political gains awaiting those of a conservative bent if they can figure out a way to celebrate individual freedom while simultaneously tolerating diversity of opinion and lifestyle?

null,"CENSORED<br/><br/>IT'S NOT HBO, IT'S CBS! In tonight's episode, Alan has an unfortunate one-night stand with  a woman dressed in an S & M Nazi outfit. The unfortunate part is  that he wound up blind-folded, hog-tied and with an indelible ink  Hitler mustache on his lip. That's pretty much how the story was  described in every draft of the script, and, as you just saw, was  what we filmed in front of a studio audience (with several happy  CBS executives in attendance). Now here's where this gets  interesting. Five days before tonight's episode was to air, I was  informed by a high-ranking CBS exec that the swastika armband on  the hot, crazy girl and the Hitler/Charlie Chaplin mustache on  Alan were unacceptable for broadcast. In other words, eighteen  years after Seinfeld went to a Neo-Nazi rally, forty-two years  after Mel Brooks unveiled ""Springtime for Hitler,"" forty-five  years after Hogan's Heroes, and seventy-five years after Bugs  Bunny and Donald Duck poked fun at the Third Reich, some genius at  CBS who will remain anonymous (Marty Franks), decided that Two and  a Half Men had crossed a line. If it were me, I would have saved  my censorship scissors for upcoming episodes, like the one where  Alan chronically masturbates in order to amortize his erection  medication. Or maybe the one with the cute subplot in which  Evelyn complains about having a dry vagina. But okay, to each his  own, right? Anyway, after many exhausting phone calls, I managed  to keep the mustache scene from being cut in exchange for  digitally turning the swastika on the girl's armband into a happy  face. Yeah, that's right. A fucking happy face. (They actually  wanted the entire armband to be digitally erased, but I convinced  them nothing makes a Nazi sadist more endearing than a happy  face.) After my blood pressure settled back to 280 over 1000, I  asked some big shots at Warner Bros. and ICM who Marty Franks was.  No one had ever heard of him. Oddly enough, that filled me with  hope. It meant that, infuriating though it was, this entire  incident had allowed me to stumble upon the secret identity of a  real life superhero. Somewhere, deep within the labyrinthian  corridors of CBS-Viacom, walks a man sworn to protect us. A  stealthy man who performs his work in corporate shadows, seeking  no credit, no reward, no applause. He does what he does simply  because it's the right thing to do. Sleep well, America.

But how  have I, as a comedy writer, used them?  Certainly not to peel away  the thin veil of civility that masks the rotting soul sickness  that eats at us from within.  No.  Whenever I attempt to  illuminate the pain of our existence, something like this comes  out:  ""Filled with grief and rage over her husband's betrayal,  Lenore set his balls on fire then pled insanity.""  You see my  dilemma? Even when I use the appropriate words, my instinct is  always to undercut the dramatic. In the above case, with the  ludicrous image of fiery testicles.  How then shall I write about  the harsh reality that is our daily life? The madness and cruelty  which assaults us from cradle to grave?  I've come to believe that  my only hope is to embrace the comedic undercut and then go a step  further.  In other words, no matter how frightening, I must dive  into the nightmare.  I must not flinch from the horror.

When I complained that there is ample evidence that cats and dogs are eaten in Korea, I was told yes, there is, but that's not the point. The point is when material like this has aired on CBS in the past, angry Korean Americans, no doubt sensitive about their culinary image, held angry meetings with network executives which made the network executives unhappy.  That's it.  That's why the joke was cut.  No one at CBS wanted to go to another angry meeting that would make them unhappy.

When he is deep in the woods he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see an enormous grizzly towering above him. Before he can fire, the beast rips the rifle out of his hands and proceeds to sodomize him. Mortified, the hunter retreats to his cabin, arms himself with a double-barrelled shotgun, and races back into the woods to find and kill his furry assailant. But once again, the bear sneaks up behind the hunter, pulls the weapon from his hands and has his lusty way with him. Undeterred, the hunter equips himself with a machine gun and treks back into the woods where he is again ambushed, disarmed and defiled by the bear. Now, apoplectic with moral outrage, the hunter flies to a third world country where he buys a heat-seeking, shoulder-launched, nuclear-tipped rocket from an international arms dealer. Convinced he finally has the upper hand, he returns to the woods, tracks the bear to his lair and patiently waits to vaporize him. And yes, again, the bear surprises, disarms and sexually assaults him. But this time, before the hunter can run off to acquire more lethal armaments, the bear enfolds him in his massive arms and says, ""You don't really come out here to hunt, do ya?""<br/><br/>Well, that's the joke. Take from it what you will with one caveat: The moral is not ""beware of homosexual bears."""

During the climactic final scene, the character of ""Cousin Leo"" blamed his fabricated drug addiction on having been molested in the Philippines by an equally fabricated Naval officer named Chaplain Horrigan.  In the original shooting script the make-believe molester was called Father Horrigan.  CBS strongly objected to this.  Their concern was that Catholic viewers would be offended by any suggestion that a Catholic priest would molest a child.  I argued that several billion dollars in punitive damage payments established a reasonable link between priests and diddled kids. My argument fell on deaf ears (no offense to our hearing-impaired viewers). Outraged, I decided I was an eight-hundred pound gorilla and threatened to shoot the scene as written.  Their lawyers, eight-pound spider monkeys at best, threatened to cut it.  I immediately blinked and changed the word ""father"" to ""chaplain.""  CBS's problem went away.

Nevertheless, we wrote and produced tonight's episode in the hopes that we would be nominated for a GLAAD Award. Our reason for this was simple. We all wanted to go to a big party where we could, for just one night, pretend we were marvelous. But in order to get to that party, we knew we'd have to write a penetrating exploration of a delicate, often inflamed area. At every step of the way we reminded ourselves that if our attempts at comedy made anyone wince, we needed to immediately withdraw and come at it from a different angle. After all, there was no reason to add to the swelling piles of asinine homophobic comedy. We chose, instead, to write a show that reaches around the obvious in order to swallow the truth. And what is that truth? Well, in a politically correct world, the truth is not an easy thing to spit out. But we think, in the end, it finally comes down to this: healthy human sexuality cannot be compartmentalized. It is a liquid thing, ever-expanding, contracting and flowing, and certainly not something that one can simply put in a box.
